You said in the article that you'd keep going afterwards with a normal state of mind. But I got the feeling you were sad, melancholy, unwilling, and regretful. These emotions were like silk threads, gently woven into the fabric of the words.\nI also noticed that some people on the internet weren't very friendly or inclusive towards you. Instead of understanding what you were going through, they just laughed at you and hurled abuse at you, like indifferent onlookers watching the excitement. All those rumors and gossip were like a thick curtain of darkness, completely blocking out all the light and hope, making people feel really depressed.\nWhen you're in a dark place, the most important thing is to believe in yourself. It's important to remember that deep down, there's a spark that's always there, even when it seems like it's been put out. Even though it's currently weak, like a candle in the wind, it still has the power to contend with the endless darkness. Even if the darkness is like surging tides, crashing wildly against the embankment of self-confidence, almost submerging it completely, one should still hold on in the most hidden corner of the heart and never give up the last glimmer of hope.\nPeople around who can understand and support you. They can really get where you're coming from and appreciate your determination to make your dreams a reality. They can also see when you're struggling and feeling helpless when you're on your own. Maybe right now, they're watching you and taking note of everything you do. You might not even realize it, but they've already helped you out with a lot of things that you didn't even realize you needed help with, just like guardian angels.\nIt's also important to have confidence in your own judgment and choices. Don't be fooled by the fake and real illusions in the darkness. And don't be swayed by the various voices of doubt and negation from the outside world. It's important to remember that your own heart is your guide to the future. You'll only find the right way out of the chaos by relying on it.\nIn closing, I encourage you to keep moving forward with determination. If you're up to it, you might as well go for it and run. No matter how long the night is, the dawn will always come as a welcome surprise, bringing joy along with it. As long as you keep moving forward, you'll find that the light of victory will shine on your shoulders, guiding you and giving you new energy and hope.\nAlthough we've never met and haven't crossed paths in our lives, there's something special about you that makes me admire you instantly. I know you might be facing some tough challenges right now, but I truly believe you have the strength and resilience to break free from the shackles of darkness. Just like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, you can move forward with courage and hope, ready to embrace the new road ahead and pursue your own glorious dawn.", "hours": 2975, "hoursAtReview": 2853, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734226178}, {"text": "I love this game, but it severely lacks combo variety.

The game captures the essence of Chinese mythology, weaving the folklore of Sun Wukong into a gripping journey that is both exhilarating and deeply immersive.\n\nPros:\n\n\u2022 Faithful Mythological Storytelling: Black Myth: Wukong beautifully adapts the legendary tales of Journey to the West. The game stays true to its source material while adding its own creative flair, making Wukong's journey feel authentic yet fresh. Players encounter a vibrant cast of mythical characters, each with their own compelling backstories and roles in the epic saga.\n\n\u2022 Spectacular Visuals and Atmosphere: From lush forests to celestial battlefields, the game's environments are stunningly realized, capturing the otherworldly beauty of mythological China. The attention to detail in character designs, especially the transformations of Wukong and his foes, adds a cinematic quality to every moment.\n\n\u2022 Engaging Combat Mechanics: The combat is fluid, challenging, and varied. Wukong\u2019s ability to transform into different forms during battles adds a strategic layer, keeping encounters fresh and rewarding as players adapt their approach to each unique enemy or boss.\n\n\u2022 Immersive Soundtrack and Voice Acting: The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, combined with stellar voice acting, brings emotional weight to the story, enhancing both quiet moments and epic confrontations.\n\nCons:\n\n\u2022 Narrative Confusion in Some Chapters: While the game tells Wukong's story with passion and grandeur, certain chapters feel disjointed or overly cryptic, leaving players unsure of the narrative\u2019s direction. This can occasionally break immersion and make it difficult to fully grasp the stakes or significance of certain events without prior knowledge of the mythology.\n\n\u2022 Difficulty Spikes: The game\u2019s challenging combat is a highlight, but some encounters feel unbalanced, leading to frustration during critical moments in the story. These spikes can disrupt the otherwise smooth pacing of the gameplay experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Black Myth: Wukong is an outstanding action-adventure game that breathes new life into the legendary tales of the Monkey King. With its faithful adaptation of Chinese mythology, stunning visuals, and engaging combat, it delivers an unforgettable experience. However, the game\u2019s narrative occasionally stumbles with disjointed chapters that may confuse players unfamiliar with the lore.

What\u2019s worse is that Valve doesn\u2019t seem to care.\n\nVAC: A Dinosaur of Anti-Cheat Systems\nValve Anti-Cheat (VAC) is the same antiquated system they\u2019ve been parading around for years, and it\u2019s utterly useless in Counter-Strike 2. Cheaters laugh at it as they blatantly ruin match after match. VAC bans, if they ever come, happen weeks after the damage is done\u2014long enough for the cheater to create a new account and start the cycle all over again. It\u2019s not just ineffective; it\u2019s insulting.\n\nA Cheater's Paradise\nCheaters have become so rampant in CS2 that it feels like they outnumber legitimate players in ranked matches. The sheer audacity of some of these hackers\u2014openly mocking their opponents while flaunting their cheats\u2014shows just how toothless Valve\u2019s response is. Even in supposedly \"high-rank\" games, the presence of cheaters destroys any sense of competition or fairness.\n\nFalse Promises and Empty Words\nValve promised improvements to anti-cheat for CS2, but what we got is a hollow PR statement with zero tangible results. If anything, the situation has worsened. Features like kernel-level anti-cheat, used by competitors like Riot\u2019s Vanguard, aren\u2019t even on the table. Instead, players are left to report cheaters manually, which feels like screaming into the void.\n\nImpact on the Community\nThe cheater infestation has turned the once-loyal Counter-Strike community into a bitter, disillusioned group. Legitimate players are abandoning the game in droves, leaving only the cheaters and those masochistic enough to endure this broken experience. CS2\u2019s potential for competitive play has been utterly destroyed by Valve\u2019s negligence.\n\nCounter-Strike 2 isn\u2019t just failing to deal with cheaters\u2014it\u2019s actively enabling them.

Its got an interesting story, with beautiful scenery that makes you feel very immersed in the universe as you progress through it.\n\nOne reason I remove 1 point from this game is that the character design is actually pretty bad. The gear and weapons can be cool but I don't know what's up with the two \"Specialist\" classes.. they are 10 year old girls with mini skirts and weird cutesy dresses which seems very out of place and borderline creepy. The faces on the characters you create generally look like something from a different game that doesn't match the aesthetic of this game. Everyone looks too clean, too pretty, in a game that is so destructive and gritty. They should make the characters more of a real and accurate match to the games design.\n\nAnother reason I remove 1 point is this game can take forever to launch and also can make your video card go insane. There could be some optimization improvements.\n\nThe last reason for the 1 point removal is once you reach max level its kind of boring to grind these solo dungeons and dailies to get higher end gear. It feels like the game fizzles away and you will get burned out fast. I actually stopped playing once I got to that point of the game because of that.

I would recommend to stop playing if you've experienced all the classes you like or are hitting end game grinds- its definitely not fun at that point.

There are some insanely satisfying classes, check them out on their website and see which ones appeal to you the most because I promise at least 4 or 5 will blow you away with satisfaction.

I\u2019ve been a gamer since 1995, and I\u2019ve played every RPG you can possibly imagine since the late 90s. Night City truly feels alive, with so much attention to detail \u2014 the immersion, animations, art design, and visuals are beyond breathtaking. I\u2019m mind blown. It\u2019s a haven for both eyes and ears. When I look at NPCs, what they do, their different outfits, fashions, cyber implants, actions, random events, and interior locations\u2014wow, any game I play after Cyberpunk feels outdated, bland, and uninteresting. Cyberpunk is a game ahead of its time.\nThe weapon handling, choices, and driving mechanics are perfect. I thought voice acting and characters were pinnacle in Baldurs gate III, but I was so wrong, and I am happy I was wrong indeed. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m not skipping even the smallest conversation and just walking around because the city is so dense and packed with so many things. I simply don\u2019t want to fast travel. I\u2019ll be honest: I\u2019m scared, shocked, and amazed by how insanely well-done Cyberpunk is, scared yes and very rarely I\u2019m scared when playing a game. The bizarre, twisted future of cyberware, implants, and characters feels so incredibly real. I can\u2019t believe it. The fact you can watch TV, go on net, purchase, craft, modify use braindance and all these little things as well adds further to quality ,complexity and immersion. I must praise sense of humor too. Anything I can think off is superb.\nI didn\u2019t have high expectations for it, but this is unbelievable. I\u2019m so passionate about gaming. Every few steps, I just stop and zoom in on the details, trying to take it all in. How did they do this? How is it even possible? For the first time in my life, I find myself lost in such a complex world. Everything in this game has been crafted masterfully, and to make it even better, the combat is so versatile with so many choices. I\u2019m totally overwhelmed. This game is striking me on so many levels. I feel so tiny and insignificant, especially in the crowd of NPCs, and when walking and looking up at massive structures and tall skyscrapers. The character design is, without a doubt, the best I\u2019ve ever seen as well. Dear God, I don\u2019t know how to explain it\u2014maybe some things can only be felt. Cyberpunk is infinite joy and fun for me.\nMassive thanks to the developers. When you have a team of dedicated, talented geniuses, magic happens.

One of the first options when you talk to Dexter Deshawn is literally you saying either, \"Yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory\" or \"If you die a nobody, nobody will remember you, so yeah, I wanna go out in a blaze of glory\" or dodging the question entirely. Why are they in the game? They just slow down the pacing of an otherwise interesting conversation.\n\nThe combat with both regular enemies and jacked-up \"Cyberpsychos\" is great fun, and the game gives you a pretty decent amount of fun and powerful options to deal with them. Yet in regular CDPR fashion, many of these can be boiled down to mind-numbingly boring tactics once you know how the game works. Oh, and expect enemies to uppercut the air 5 feet away from where you're standing and for you to still take damage.\n\nThe stealth is actually handled pretty decently for their first attempt at it, yet you can't pickpocket enemies, you can't just hit one button and kill them with your melee weapon, nor can you shoot a silenced pistol at a camera without the entire building now somehow knowing you're somewhere close to them, or hide an unconscious enemy into a dumpster without killing them for some reason.\n\nEnemies in most side quests will be completely neutral towards you, giving you plenty of options to plan your approach. Yet open a door you shouldn't, step half a foot into a restricted area (oftentimes without you even knowing, because none of the enemies ever tell you to back off or to not go through a door since you can't actually talk to most of them), and within a millisecond every enemy in a mile-wide radius will turn hostile and instantly try to gun you down.\n\nSave a girl from getting beaten up by someone; she doesn't say anything, just crouches on the floor with her hands above her head and stays there till the end of time.\n\nYou can buy dozens of different vehicles, yet you can't customise them at all except changing the color on a few. The movement in the game feels really fluent, yet the city isn't really designed in a way where you can use your parkour skills to your advantage. The skill tree is diverse and leads to very different-feeling playthroughs, yet in dialogue it is only used for V to be able to say additional lines of dialogue, without them ever changing how a quest plays out.\n\nTrust me, I could just go on and on. But in short; Cyberpunk 2077 is a very fun game whenever the developers decide to just let you loose and give you quests that allow for player creativity. For my personal taste, it is easily the most fun game they have ever made, once you take the game for what it is.

(They are on their next playthrough right now and we can't wait for crossover co-op to play it together!) \r\nI will definitely start a second playthrough alone too, even though it IS a lot of work to go through it all again once you've discovered most secrets, but 1. I want to romance another companion (Gale next time! ;D Sorry, Astarion had to be the first...), 2. I'll choose higher difficulty now that I'm comfortable with everything (you can even change that mid-game whenever you like! But I want a bit more of a challenge right from the beginning next time) and 3. I want to try out several mods after a vanilla playthrough. So still a lot to look forward to in a second approach. Most people will enjoy playing as a different class or something too which changes a lot in regards to the gameplay! (I'm just too committed myself, I ALWAYS play as a Druid in DnD and any CRPG that offers it, that's just my thing) Besides the story itself changes a lot when you choose different ways of action, are more/less successfull, discover things earlier/later... the way the story unfolds is totally up to your choices (and your luck) and the class and specifications you went with, it's VERY versatile. \r\nAs for bugs I didn't encounter anything bad yet. There are some glitches sometimes when managing BIG inventories (like the one in camp) - just close the inventory and open again and everything should act normal - and once I couldn't pick up a weapon that was knocked out of the character's hand in battle. Thankfully I saved before the battle and just fought it again (went far more smoothly the second time around anyway). Other times I could pick up the weapon without a problem, so it's not a general bug, just sometimes there may be small errors. \r\n\r\nIf you don't enjoy fighting at all, there is a story mode that's quite relaxed really.

Started playing it during Early Access, however not on Steam, and due to it have another 125 hours not accounted for here. Usually, no matter how much I enjoy the game, I just play games once (exceptions are games which require multiple playthroughs) and playing anything more than that just gets really tedious and a chore to me. This game managed to bypass that. I am doing several separate playthroughs and having so much fun in every single one because of the sheer amount of varied content it contains as well as all the ways combat can be resolved, you could say only your imagination is the limit. There is just so much to experience.\n\n   I have not played first two Baldur's Gate games, what I had played was Larians' Divinity: Original Sin 2 which saying I enjoyed it is an understatement (still can not get some of the music there out of my head and I might slightly prefer it over music in this game, however incredible it is) and is a main reason why I started the third part. I was not at all disappointed. Game more than delivered and largely expanded on almost everything good DOS 2 did.\nYou can enjoy this game without having any prior experience with the series. There are characters appearing from previous entries, some even can be your companions. There is some mention of events that transpired, so having prior knowledge is a bonus, but it's nothing major and you will not have missed much otherwise.\n\n   First time I started the game, I just spent a few hours in the character creator, partly due to trying to create a perfect character, partly deciding which class to pick and how I wanted to play and partly just listening to its amazing music. In all this time I still did not get to experience every class, subclass and content hidden behind them. Not only do classes provide different experience concerning combat, they also give you special prompts in dialog (same as races), so for example sorcerer might be all \"I am magic incarnate and you measly creatures cannot contain me!\" while also taking every opportunity to tease wizards; as a paladin people might ask you to judge criminals; as a bard you can just take a break from adventuring, pick your stage and perform music (you can pick it as a feat for other non bard classes, but it will take a while), nearby characters will come nearby and listen to you and even give you gold, it is one of the ways to make gold (however excruciatingly slow one), if your really wanted to you could make your whole party being proficient with instruments and create a band and you can actually hear all the different instruments used by them.\n\n   There is so many routes you can take your character on. On one hand you can be a hero trying to protect innocents, fighting evil, preventing bad guys from their goals, helping everyone as much as possible, not wanting to do anything with mind flayers, while on the other you can be the polar opposite, you can be like the ultimate evil one, you can betray, steal, kill and do things that will leave even the games' evil characters dumbfounded. You can also be anything in between. Game is written so well that no matter the path you take it is fully fledged and makes sense. In most games doing evil things and picking evil choices is just you being rude towards other people and feels really bad picking them, here there is a certain excitement to them, they are more complex and it is like you are experiencing another layer of the game you were not even aware of. \nI think Dark Urge is the best way to play the game if you are mostly interested in the story of the game, resisting it or not, there is so much content connected to it you otherwise miss about the story and so many little bits and pieces that suddenly make sense.\n\n   Game is consisting of three chapters. Each chapter has multiple zones connected to it with a plethora of content. They are all closely interwoven, meaning that saying something while in a dialog to character in chapter one will have consequences with that character in chapter three. Saving someone in chapter one may just see that character in chapter two willing to help you with something you have a need for, or you might just find that character in the last chapter while exploring houses, or suppose you did not save them in chapter one or even killed them, you may just find their relatives in the last chapter wondering what happened to them. Or some of them might help you and make things easier for you. You might just get quests and items you otherwise would not, but you might also miss alternate routes. There is so much content it is impossible to see everything in just one playthrough, or even several.\n\n   Saying that, first and second chapter are as close to perfection as they come while i feel like the last, third chapter of the game is the weakest point of this game. Compared to first two it just feels like it missing something, even though it is filled with content there is a certain emptiness to it. It just feels like it needed a bit more time, for example there is ton of npcs and you can speak with most, however you will just get their one line and that will be the end of it, I understand not every npc could get a full on life story and dialog, but I never felt like this with them in earlier chapters, they are just missing something.\nThat said, chapter also has many positives, I particularly like how you get a base camp in a rough part of the city, but if you want to pay you can get yourself a whole floor in a tavern and use that as a camp instead. You can rob a bank, help a necromancer (or not), meet zombies (and help them instead), shapeshifters, vampires, obscene cults, even print your own version of towns newspapers with you in it and read them the next day...\n\nI seriously can not recommend this game enough.

Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is a masterpiece, a beacon of light in the shadow of everything else I have encountered lately. There is so much I want to say about it. So many things touched the deepest parts of my soul, from its minor mechanics, exploits, and builds to the brilliance of its dice-based gameplay and more. And then there\u2019s the story \u2014 one of the most beautiful I have ever experienced, brought to life by an array of vivid characters and unforgettable scenes.\r\n\r\nWhen I finished the game, I had only about 30 minutes to watch the final cutscene because the war-torn country I live in suffers from frequent power outages, and I knew I had to see how it all ended. I could not bear to leave the story unfinished. That moment, when everything culminated in Astarion\u2019s simple words, \"See you later, darling,\" at the camp, struck me profoundly. In my life, I have never had friendships like the ones I formed in this game, and I really did not want to say goodbye to them.\r\n\r\nI know it is just a game. I know I can replay it and explore new outcomes.

I fell in love with this game \u2014 every single part of it. The quests, dialogues, intrigue, family bonds, betrayals, choices, the seamless flow of the story from beginning to end, the consequences, and yes, even the romance.

Every aspect captivated me completely.\r\n\r\nI do not know how much time I have left on this Earth, nor what lies ahead in my own story.

It taught me that giving up is never an option \u2014 no matter what the dice say \u2014 and that the best is yet to come.\r\n\r\nRight now, I feel full. I feel at peace.

With its engaging gameplay, charming graphics, and a perfect blend of survival mechanics, base building, immersive audio, and a well-crafted combat system, it truly stands out. But the real magic? The ability to team up with your friends on a dedicated server for cooperative adventures!\n\nThe first playthrough is where the game truly shines. There's a constant sense of wonder and an insatiable urge to explore. What's beyond the next hill? Of course, you might get your rear handed to you by a troll, reminding you that better gear is essential. And so, the loop begins: improve, gear up, and venture further. That progression, where each new piece of equipment feels like a monumental achievement (your first copper weapon feels legendary!), is what makes Valheim so captivating.\n\nThe game\u2019s food system adds another layer of strategy, allowing you to tweak your character's stats to favor health or stamina\u2014whatever suits your playstyle. Later, Eitr (mana) joins the mix, broadening your options. The world feels alive, teeming with creatures and dynamic environments. In short, Valheim offers something for everyone, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any gamer seeking a thrilling adventure. But\u2026\n\nThe Glory Days and the Grind\n\nMy friends and I joined Valheim's world early, back in February 2021, when the game was still in its unfinished glory. It didn\u2019t matter. The Black Forest, Mountains, and Plains were ready for exploration, and bosses awaited our challenge. We embarked on multiple playthroughs, relishing the cooperative gameplay, the specialization of characters, and the adrenaline of victories hard-won.\n\nFast forward a few years, and updates like Mistlands and Ashlands have expanded the game. Last summer, we decided to dive back in, generating a fresh map for another adventure.\n\nInitially, the nostalgia hit hard. We breezed through the familiar Meadows, Black Forest, Mountains, and Plains, gearing up for the new biomes. Equipped with the best Plains gear, we ventured into the Mistlands.\n\nThe Mistlands: A Hazy Grind\n\nTrue to its name, the Mistlands challenges you with limited visibility, constant climbing, and stamina management. Yet, despite the frustrations (and frequent deaths), the allure of new weapons, armor, and food kept us going. The grind was real: dying, reclaiming gear, mining resources, and repeating the cycle. But defeating the Queen was a triumphant moment\u2014a hard-earned victory that left us feeling accomplished.\n\nThe Ashlands: The Spark Fades\n\nThen came the Ashlands. Armed with what we thought was top-tier gear, we set foot on the burning terrain, only to find ourselves woefully unprepared. Every enemy seemed to laugh at our efforts, reducing us to a frustrating rhythm of dying, grinding, and crafting. Again and again.\n\nThis repetitive loop\u2014grinding for resources, upgrading gear, and facing inevitable deaths\u2014was tolerable through the earlier biomes. But by the sixth cycle, the novelty had worn off. The Ashlands felt more punishing than rewarding, and the challenge began to feel like a chore.\n\nAn End to the Saga\n\nOne by one, my friends lost interest, including myself. Since then, the portals to the Ashlands are now overgrown with weeds, our characters slumped in their thrones, mead in hand, reminiscing about past victories. Even I\u2014after logging over 800 hours in this world\u2014found myself burned out. The thought of tending the forge, managing gardens, chopping wood, and enduring endless raids by pesky bats just to face the final boss, Fader, felt exhausting rather than exciting.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nValheim is undeniably a masterpiece of design, especially in its early stages. The sense of discovery, the camaraderie of co-op play, and the thrill of progression make it unforgettable. But the grind-heavy nature of the later stages ultimately takes its toll. While the developers continue to add new content like potions, decorative clothing, and crafting materials, these additions often feel more like extra chores than meaningful enhancements. Instead of enriching the gameplay, they pile on more tasks, making the experience feel increasingly like work rather than fun.\n\nIf you\u2019ve never played Valheim, I still recommend giving it a try\u2014you\u2019ll undoubtedly create some incredible memories. But for veterans like me, the journey seems to have reached its natural conclusion. Here's hoping the next update brings innovations that rekindle the spark without adding to the grind.

Putting in perspective, instead of having an indeterminate type of progression /\\/\\/\\/\\/\\, Fallout 4 is simply too linear ------, too linear to the point that right at the start of the game you are forced to side with a faction because the other one is already attacking you... And no, you can't get their trust, nor talk to them, you're an enemy as soon as you leave your vault. Meeting a new npc is a 50/50 because you can very easily get caught in the infamous \"infinite quest loop\" as I like to call it, where an npc will continuously ask you to clear X area, recover X item, save X person............ A massive waste of time. Do I have to talk about the quest continuity? Let's say you accepted a quest from an npc that demands you clear X area, you then accept another quest where you need to take this same npc somewhere, but you can't, because you need to complete the clear X area first before you can take the stupid npc somewhere, because the game doesn't give multiple dialogues options and only tracks 1 quest. I literally blew up the institute (biggest fucking explosion in the game) and the Railroad were still asking me to attack the institute (LOL). Oh and your characters talks, on top of that it says nothing you're actually thinking (who would've thought!!!!!!!). Unlike previous games, the Fallout 4 ending doesn't change based on what you do in the world. Nothing has a meaningful impact and it's so blend. Also, the main radio host (Travis Miles) is terrible, someone shoot that guy already.\n\nFallout 4 does a very good job at being pointless. The map is big but most places are just infested with enemies to kill and nothing more. There are rare exceptions like the Boston Mayoral Shelter, where you collect holotapes and gradually learn more about what happened in that place... And you're rewarded for doing so. An amazing way to tell a story, just like Vault 22 from FNV. I have to be honest here and spit this: FO4 didn't have any memorable quests for me, nothing like the Oasis questline from FO3 or Come Fly With Me from FNV. Most memorable thing from FO4 so far was reaching max affinity with Cait (companion). Speaking of pointlessness, I spent so much time building and making settlements, but it has no impact on the world. \n\nWhat were they even thinking by removing the skill system?! Instead of wanting players to do specific builds, they wanted everyone to be good at everything. The level up UI is cool tho.\n\nEven with all these things, the game is pretty fucking fun. It has weather phenomena, an immersive real-time weather system, and sometimes everything goes green because of the radstorms. Sometimes it's a fog, sometimes it's rain; The random encounters are so rich as well, and after the brotherhood of steel appears, everything gets pretty caotic, with vertibirds exploding everywhere; There's no equipment durability; The combat is amazing and it feels so satisfying blowing everyone's heads off.

Amazing world building with many things to do, this in which may take hundreds of hours to complete.\r\n\r\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\r\nPlayers require to farm a lot of resources to upgrade the various weapons available. Open world areas truly feel amazing due to random NPCs roaming about with various sidequests to perform. Players can switch between 3rd Person or 1st Person view depending on their preference.\r\n\r\nLike any Role-Playing games, player can make their choices which ultimately changes the outcome of the story. Players can also build their own homes or groups called \"settlements\" and defend them. With the DLCs included, additional features are added, for example, players can also now become \"Raiders\" to steal from settlements or farms.\r\n\r\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\r\nThe graphics is quite good, not the best. Stable on RTX2080, but requires minor tweaking in the configuration file to max out the FPS, due to being locked to 30 FPS by default.\r\n\r\n[h1]Audio[/h1]\r\nThe music and voice acting is relatively good. Sound effects are very good, especially when using THX 5.1 or 7.1 Surround Sound. The interactions feel a bit too much, so many \"talking\", interactions can be sped up, but not skipped.\r\n\r\n[h1]Controls[/h1]\r\nControls are relatively straightforward like most first person games. Nothing special, easy to adapt to.\r\n\r\n[h1]Bugs & Issues[/h1]\r\n1. Enemies or player might get stuck in terrain\r\n2. Random animation issues in cutscenes\r\n3. Animation delays will become annoying and at times game-breaking\r\n4. Actions performed like opening a lock does not trigger correctly\r\n5. Random ragdoll physics issues\r\n6. Multiple achievement bugs, causing a lot of frustration (Fixed either with mods, loading older save or Console Commands)\r\n7. Random interaction issues with NPC or collectibles, reloading previous save usually fixes most issues\r\n8. Various quest glitches\r\n9. Many \"settlements\" have pre-built equipments and buildings that cannot be dismantled, it had become so bad till the point modders fixed them due to multiple complaints\r\n10. Inconsistency between main game and DLC, especially in terms of building settlements\r\n\r\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\r\nOverall a great game despite being quite old, similar to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, the game is still popular, especially after the \"Fallout\" series being released in 2024.

This third-person shooter puts you in the boots of a Helldiver, an elite soldier fighting for Super Earth's version of \"managed democracy\" across a hostile galaxy. And what a fight it is.\r\nThe game's greatest strength lies in its commitment to both chaos and comedy. You'll find yourself dropping into hostile planets with up to three other players, ostensibly spreading democracy through superior firepower. The tongue-in-cheek propaganda, over-the-top patriotic messages, and deliberately excessive military bravado create a brilliant satirical layer that never feels heavy-handed.\r\nThe combat is deliciously challenging, requiring genuine teamwork and coordination. Whether you're calling in orbital strikes, managing your limited resources, or simply trying not to accidentally shoot your teammates (harder than it sounds), every mission feels like a high-stakes adventure. The friendly fire mechanic adds both tension and hilarious moments of accidental betrayal, perfectly fitting the game's tone.\r\nWhat sets Helldivers 2 apart is how it weaves its satirical elements into every aspect of gameplay. From the hilariously straight-faced mission briefings to the earnest declarations about spreading democracy through overwhelming force, the game maintains its brilliantly absurd tone while delivering genuinely excellent gameplay mechanics.\r\nThe progression system keeps you engaged, with new weapons, stratagems, and equipment unlocking regularly. Each new tool in your arsenal opens up fresh tactical possibilities, ensuring the gameplay stays fresh even after many hours.\r\nHighlights:\r\n\r\nExceptional cooperative gameplay that rewards teamwork\r\nBrilliant satirical writing and world-building\r\nChallenging but fair difficulty curve\r\nDiverse arsenal of weapons and strategic options\r\nRegular content updates keeping the game fresh\r\nOutstanding graphics and atmospheric design\r\n\r\nMinor Drawbacks:\r\n\r\nCan be punishingly difficult for solo players\r\nSome missions can feel repetitive over long sessions\r\n\r\nHelldivers 2 is a rare gem that succeeds both as a satirical piece and as a mechanically sound shooter.

I love this game, I really do. It has such an unbelievable amount of potential for awesome gameplay, unique storytelling, and crazy co-op shenanigans. Sometimes it achieves this. There are moments where it feels like everyone is truly contributing and steering the direction of the game. The problem is, for every fun thing in this game, there are multiple truly awful design decisions.\n\nIt's as if Arrowhead Studios were gifted a genius-level child and decided to raise it on a diet of Fanta and Elmer's Glue. It's frustrating that so many people in the community can come up with so many cool ideas for the game, but Arrowhead just does the absolute bare minimum.\n\nTheir content release cycle is an ouroboros of truly baffling decisions: Content gets added, the content is either broken or extremely underwhelming, the community gets pissed, Arrowhead says they'll conduct an internal review into their design philosophy, a month goes by, they finally add a modicum of fun to the content, they release something new, and it's either broken or extremely underwhelming.\n\nSome examples of this: At one point, a new mission was added where the Helldivers had to land on a planet completely infested by bugs and defend drills that would pump dark fluid under the crust to destroy the planet. When the mission launched, it was borderline unplayable due to bugs spawning under the drill and almost immediately destroying it.\n\nRecently, the Helldivers spent about two months and multiple major orders building a space station to wreak havoc on the enemies of democracy. The anticipation of this new mechanic was enough for players to overlook the fact that no meaningful content had been added in months.\n\nThe space station was finally built, and it was the most simple, barebones, awful mechanic ever. It's a glorified menu with three extremely basic, boring effects. Nothing new, mind you\u2014just reusing stuff already in the game. When the Helldivers activated the Orbital Bombardment effect, it just ended up teamkilling people. It became so problematic that shields had to be added to everyone's loadouts. You couldn't even see the space station in the sky.\n\nNow the station has moved, and the new effect is that, every now and then, some strafing runs will target enemies. Granted, it's much more playable and there is significantly less teamkilling from it, but that's not setting the bar high. It's somewhat cool for a mission or two, but it's just more strafing runs that we can't even control. We still can't see the space station from the ground (though the planes flying around all over the place are kinda cool!).\n\nIt might seem like I'm harping on the space station too much, and perhaps that's true, but it feels like the quintessential example of the constant frustration I experience with this game. Something that was meant to be awesome ended up being a broken, bare-minimum effort disaster that almost no one enjoys in the long term.\n\nI respect that some people might find it fun and hilarious; I think it's great that you can have fun with that. I just wish they could implement these ideas in a way where everyone could enjoy it.\n\nI want this game to be a shining example of how live-service games can buck their negative stigma by providing a simply good game without predatory, manipulative monetization. It looks like we're up to the \"Arrowhead says they'll conduct an internal review into their design philosophy\" stage, and unfortunately, given their track record, I think I know what the next few steps will be...\n\nEdit: Now the Illuminate have dropped and they're extremely fun to fight against IF you can even play a match, almost every single lobby disconnects, crashes or lags.", "hours": 29516, "hoursAtReview": 29516, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731759832}, {"text": "This game lets you earn in game currency, but after supporting the game through cosmetic battle passes about 4 times.

This game is honestly incredible. One of the best PvE Coop games out there, and one of the best communities I've ever seen, and am proud to be a part of.\n\nWhat keeps me coming back besides the excellent gameplay and awesome metagame is how Helldivers 2 wears its influences on its sleeves very proudly, as it should with how well it's been executed. The world, tone and mechanics that the game has is very reminiscent of (but not limited to): \n\n1). Starship Troopers (fighting alien bugs on planets far from Earth, the overly bombastic and satirical military tone, the fact that it seems for the massive amount of bugs you fight the only vehicles you get are some walkers, and it's mostly just ground troops thrown into the meat grinder).\n\n2). Terminator (pretty self explanatory, fighting the Automatons gives a very Terminator 1/2 feel even down to the music and overwhelming nature of the Automatons).\n\n3). Halo (Helldivers compared to the ODST's being called the Helljumpers, being dropped from orbit in pods into battle, even the aircraft that extracts you is called the Pelican).\n\n4). Left 4 Dead (Enemies are incredibly satisfying to fight thanks to the feedback similar to how zombies in L4D2 are always fun to blow to pieces, not to mention the very arcade like fun and feel of the game).\n\n5). Star Wars Battlefront 2 (The Galactic Conquest mode in that game is basically how Helldivers 2's metagame sort of plays out, but it's closer to a Dungeon Master that creates community events, defence campaigns of planets, and so much more. It feels like Galactic Conquest in BF2 fully realized, and with more than 1 player). \n\n6). Warhammer 40K (A universe in constant war with other races, a general bloodhungry atmosphere cultivated by both the in-game characters and the fans referencing the game in memes that scratch that certain itch that can't really be explained by people not in the know but those within the fandoms revel in).\n\nThere are likely many other influences that I probably haven't played or can think of off hand that have played a hand in the direction that the developers took to craft. Either way, the game takes these influences and puts its own spin on it that is so original and awesome that it feels truly unique. It truly does feel like one of those perfect fantasy game concepts that you'd put together in your imagination.\n\nGameplay wise, the shooting and aiming feels very different from any other game. There are no hitscan weapons (lasers notwithstanding), it's all projectiles so leading your shots is necessary, but the game throws a very unique wrinkle into the mix: the aiming reticle is essentially split into 2 pieces: where you want to aim with the mouse, and a second circle where your character is actually aiming. This second reticle has drag and takes into account the direction of the actual gun and recoil from firing or your aim being thrown off by an attack. As a result, unless you are using a armor set with a specific perk on it, you can't whip your aim around all willy nilly, you have to pace and time your aim, which can be difficult under pressure, but adds to the fun challenge of the game.\n\nThe other wrinkle of the Gameplay is the use of Strategems, which are basically like killstreaks from COD except you can call them in at any time assuming they aren't under cool-down, or have run out of uses, etc. Airstrikes, orbital strikes, support weapons like different rocket launchers with different functions, support backpacks, automated turrets, even mech suits once you've leveled up enough to unlock them. Having only 4 at a time per player helps to act sort of like a class system without a class system specifically. There is a great variety of them to use, and most to all of them are viable as long as you use them smartly. Punching the codes in also adds to the challenge of trying to do it under pressure especially when completely surrounded, which can lead to accidental team kills, which leads me to the next point.\n\nTeam Killing is bound to happen in this game, whether by a bad stratagem throw, overly zealous aiming, even the backpack drones accidentally setting you on fire. TK's are just the name of the game. It adds to the frantic and panicky nature of the game, as doing things under pressure like aiming and trying to punch in codes is tricky and hard to do fast and properly. This can lead to some deaths and the game sometimes feeling like bullshit (which it can be, cough cough random ragdolls cough), but it's for the best to do your best to not get frustrated by them, as honestly most of the time it's funny especially in hindsight, and this game is truly at its best in a semi casual setting. Getting sweaty and mad decreases the fun of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. I recommend sticking to the difficulty that you feel is most fun.\n\nThe difficulty and challenge is quite fair up to Difficulty 7 I find. 8-10 is honestly bullshit though, especially if not prepared. It can be fun once in a while to try out the highest difficulty, as it is exhilarating to barely extract alive, but it does end up feeling so stacked against you that you feel forced to rely on the meta Strategems and Weapons, which does limit a fair few off of the table since some of them are just too niche to be viable to survive on those difficulties. I find that personally up to 7 for bugs, and 6 for bots gives the best balance of fun and challenge, and also still allows for most of the weapon and stratagem sandbox to still be viable as long as you don't play dumb.\n\nA coop game is nothing without good coop, and this game has some of the best I've played. Coordinating with your team is great, and this is like one of very few Steam games where players will actually use the in-game voice chat as well as the text chat, and in-game callouts instead of everyone having to hop in a discord server and arrange a whole meetup and whatnot. Any match where at least one person has a mic is infinitely better than a silent one where nobody is speaking, as even just one person can help to coordinate different plans, choose which objectives everyone should be going to and doing, etc. If you're gonna play this game, HAVE A MIC. You will have a much better experience than without, though if you are stuck without one, the in-game callouts are a decent substitute.\n\nCustomization is a bit limited, unfortunately. There isn't any options for changing the colours of the armours or weapons yet, though that does seem like something that might be added down the line. There are lots of options for the player cards and titles, emotes at the stats screen and during the game, so that's good at least. Paint jobs for the vehicles are locked behind most of the Premium Warbonds, so that's unfortunate.\n\nMy biggest problem with progression is with the Ship Modules, which require Samples that you can find on missions. The requirements for the samples for the Modules is ridiculous, and maxing all of them out takes a long ass time. I still haven't done it in my 77 hours so far. I will do it eventually, but man having to farm commons and super rares takes so long. They really need a way to boost the amount of samples you get, maybe a way to multiply it based on the difficulty of the mission or something.\n\nOverall, there is so much to cover with Helldivers 2 that I can't do it justice in a couple paragraphs (I was 4000 characters over the limit for this review and had to delete several paragraphs just to be able to post it). I highly recommend this game even if you don't have friends to play it with, since this community is one of the best I've ever seen a game foster.

This also kills the game for NA as it only appeals to sweats when NA is as a culture mostly casuals sadly....I've tried so hard to get many people into this game but the game is hard, and it isn't casual so if your entire friends group aren't a bunch of sweat tryhards then this game is going to be extremely lonely, that is the only reason I'm not playing.....\n#3 playerbase, the game is huge probably a top 5 most played in CN. Issue is that is not the case in NA, meaning there is only a few hours you can queue ranked sometimes even unranked, any other time and you get 30 minute queue times. The community is very nice and helpful and always tries to help you practice and will offer 1v1 practice etc ALTHOUGH CN does sometimes try to hide information, while there are content creators that try to prevent this it is still an issue where you are gatekept by China/language barrier. They even gatekeep sharing customization for character faces tf??\n#4 Ranked which ties into what i've talked about in my 3rd point, when you are low ranked matches are mostly new players then 70-80% bots as SOON as you hit Plat+ you only rank with TOP 100-200 PLAYERS and because the ranked points are very lenient it is really easy to hit Plat+ (I've hit top 200 in solos my 1st month of playing the game)\n#5 This game was made with low ping in mind, having higher than 70+ ping completely breaks the game there have been issues in the past where the higher your ping the more time you could keep people juggled in the air infinitely, while this HAS been fixed there are still issues with ping such as teleporting, even minor teleporting you will have someone LAG OUT of your combos or lag hit you out of iFrame/dodge.\n\nTLDR: If you are a sweat tryhard (with money) that can learn every mechanic, combo, character matchup this is the game FOR YOU, although be careful with the anti-cheat possible malware...\nif you are a casual, this game might not be fun for you, it's hard...", "hours": 42152, "hoursAtReview": 42152, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733458858}, {"text": "very high skill ceiling making it fun even when going against way better players because it gives you experience and in my opinion pushes people to get better overall", "hours": 21319, "hoursAtReview": 20962, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733095817}, {"text": "i love the combat the mobility  and the creative ability's in this game and also i love the pve part of the game and the graphics are beautiful", "hours": 26241, "hoursAtReview": 25947, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733360229}, {"text": "\u592a\u53cc\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e1c\u897f \u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u5440 \u957f\u95ea\u8eb2\u767d\u5200\u6293\u4e86\u5440 \u5200\u7684\u8bdd \u4fee\u4e00\u4e0b\u561b \u538b\u529b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u51b7\u9759 \u4f60\u77e5\u9053\u7684\u5440", "hours": 103543, "hoursAtReview": 99819, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733022575}, {"text": "its a walk down simulator you can play with your homies. you telling me you dont wanna get your lads and throw hands with the locals everyday? 10/10 the hype was real when i PURCHASED this game and the hype is STILL real while its free to play.", "hours": 4932, "hoursAtReview": 4932, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734248646}, {"text": "Bought base game back in the day for 15 USD\n\nThen bought this (not sure what it was as of now, I guess in game currency, who knows):\nPurchased: Dec 19, 2021 @ 11:32am\n3000\u91d1\u5757 - $23.15 USD\n\nTotal\t$23.15 USD\n\nJust so it would be made a free to play game. . . \ud83e\udd21", "hours": 991, "hoursAtReview": 991, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733546386}, {"text": "One of the best games on PvP and no pay to win", "hours": 31925, "hoursAtReview": 29892, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732437966}, {"text": "decent game too many sweats would only be fun to play with other people", "hours": 625, "hoursAtReview": 625, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733464770}, {"text": "i got ban for doing noting ingame", "hours": 12948, "hoursAtReview": 12924, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733646999}, {"text": "10/10.

It holds the record of most sold game of all time and continues to sell strong. GTA V continues the trend set forth by its predecessors of open-world sandbox games, and this iteration is the most expansive, detailed, interactive and immersive yet. We return to the sun soaked city of Los Santos, modeled after the real life city of Los Angeles, last seen in GTA: San Andreas some eight years prior. Not only can we explore this metropolis but a large part of San Andreas state as well, encompassing varied urban, desert, mountain, forest, and beach landscapes. This open world appears living and breathing, with day-night cycles, variable weather patterns, and pedestrians and vehicles appear to have dynamic behaviours. NPC's have distinct personalities and may be involved in various activities or conversations. Some might even be committing crimes or involved in high speed police chases. \r\n\r\nIn a departure from previous games in the series there are now three different protagonists that we can take control of and who's stories will intertwine as the game progresses. There's Franklin, a street thug who's generally reasonable and grounded, hoping to make something more of himself. Michael is a former bank robber who's now in witness protection and lives a life of luxury with his dysfunctional family. And finally there's Trevor, who can be described as a total psychopath bent on chaos and destruction. He engages in various crimes and has been trying to expand his criminal enterprise. Him and Michael have a lot of history. Each of them can be seamlessly selected and usually populate different parts of the state at most given times. As usual, the writing and dialogue are great and while the main story isn't necessarily the stuff of an academy award-winning narrative, it's engaging with enough twists to keep us captivated. Heists are an integral part of the story with many missions building up to a big score. It's definitely more over the top and lighthearted than GTA IV, and more hilarious in many ways. Some of the side missions are outrageous and there are more side quests and activities than ever before, there's always something to do or discover. As has become standard in this series', the game has its fair share of satire and pokes fun at modern-day society, capitalism, consumerism, corporate greed, and the fallacies of the American Dream. \r\n\r\nGraphically GTA V took advantage of the newer hardware at the time and improved in just about every way with more detailed environments, realistic lighting and shadows, and enhanced textures. Animations are more fluid and character models look far more life-like. Even after 10 years, the visuals are still quite impressive. Vehicles seem more fun and easier to drive than previous, and have more authentic destruction physics. In fact the environment in general is far more destructive. In terms of sound, the voice acting is top notch, and enhances the character developments and interactions. The radio stations provide top tier music tracks of almost every genre, and the talk shows are hysterical and provide an exaggerated social commentary on a multitude of real-world issues. The stations have recurrent radio hosts like Laszlo and Maurice Chavez as well as a plethora of newcomers that we inevitably become accustomed to while on the road.  \r\n\r\nIf one were to try to understand why this game is still going so strong, Rockstar's secret sauce, and cash cow, lies in GTA: Online. Multitudes of players can simultaneously enter the open world and buy properties, vehicles and weapons, customize their characters, join races, perform heists, create chaos, and build up their bank accounts with GTA currency. The possibilities are really endless. Rockstar has continued to support the game with new content and features. This is also most likely the reason we haven't seen a new entry to the series' for such a long time, there's just too much money to be made here. The PC version appears to have its fair share of hackers though, and it doesn't seem like Rockstar does a ton to stop it. This has ruined different online sessions more often than I want to admit. \r\n\r\nOverall, despite its age, GTA V remains a force to be reckoned with. I can't describe the fun I've had teaming up with other players to complete heists and the nail biting moments trying to complete the Doomsday Heist without dying, while going for some of the game's more difficult achievements. It is the pinnacle of open world gaming, and I would argue that nothing else really comes close in this genre. With countless activities to engage with and the evolving and expansive world of GTA: Online, this game has seemingly endless replay value and will maintain its enduring popularity...at least until the highly anticipated GTA VI is finally released.\r\n", "hours": 16291, "hoursAtReview": 16291, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733706884}, {"text": "The recent BattleEye addition puts the game running at High settings down from like 140FPS to 10-30fps variable with inputs lost as well.

It's easily an addicting feature. \n\nThe main story was interesting if anyone bothered to actually sit through all the lore like I have in the beginning lol.\n\nSome of the skins that are available are not very impressive so I wasn't too pleased with the aesthetics other than a few weapon skins. Most of them look similar. The amitoi buddy you get is the cutest thing to have following you around and you can choose skins for it too. \n\nI didn't care much for the \"pay-to-win\" features since I don't think it's actually heavily focused on that to begin with. If anything, it's there for your own benefit for some added boosts, especially if you need to trait gear/weapons. \n\nOverall, I think it's rather easy to make lucent (the IRL currency). The grind of tier 1 and tier 2 dungeon items can be bought and sold quite easily in the auction house and it's usually in demand regardless of how low tier it is.\n\nI really appreciate how this game lets you explore different weapon classes without having to be locked into it for one specific account (since you can have up to 2 different ones). I main a staff/bow build and have reached endgame with it. I started to play around with other weapons too. The only downside to switching weapon classes is that you may be farming for materials and skill books to level them up. Which is kind of a hassle since you're no longer getting free stuff from completing story line codex and side quests. Unless you decide to transfer your current weapon skills to another.\n\nHaving an official but casual guild has been fun so far and of course, like most MMORPG games, it always starts off strong until people start facing burn-out and eventually stop logging in to join in on guild raids, world events/bosses, and open world dungeon grinds. Even harder to participate in PvP with low counts. Not that PvP completely obstructs game play 'cause honestly, it's easy to get around it.\nPvP is as sweaty as ever but I think that's what makes it kind of fun.\n\nThe newest content that came out was the challenge of siege wars and tier 2 bosses that has a heavy amount of mechanics that need to be executed correctly. Communication is definitely key.\n\nI like this game primarily for spending time with the friends I made along this journey :)\nReminds me of the ESO/ New World days, so this game has been pretty endearing to me.\n\nSo far, it seems like the devs respond pretty quickly to player feed back and are always on top of any flaws that are noted. \n\nThe only set back about this game is just the lag and buggy-ness in general and especially world events like the arch bosses that make it hard to execute full skill rotations and how clunky combat can be with everything lagging.

I played as a healer with wand and bow before transitioning to a bow and staff setup. Unfortunately, my experience has been riddled with frustration, stemming from both critical bugs and poor game mechanics.\n\nCritical Bugs and Flawed Mechanics\nOne of the most glaring issues is the hook mechanic, which is incredibly buggy and unreliable. On top of that, core damage abilities like the fireball and the charged shot from the bow frequently failed to execute properly. Often, my character would get stuck mid-animation, forcing me to dodge just to reset, wasting stamina\u2014a critical resource in PvP. The amount of time lost recharging these abilities only to have them fail repeatedly made PvP an absolute nightmare. This highlights poor foundational development, as these issues fundamentally undermine the gameplay experience.\n\nMassive PvP: Unbalanced and Frustrating\nAs a member of a top-5 guild on my server, I can confidently say that massive PvP battles are dominated by tanks that seem nearly immortal, capable of deleting a full-geared ranged DPS caster like myself in seconds. Meanwhile, assassins have unbalanced stun mechanics that ignore defensive stats like collision resistance, making escape nearly impossible. Even with a trinket to remove stuns, collision mechanics remain unchecked, resulting in frequent deaths within moments of engaging.\n\nFor casters, this is by far the worst game I\u2019ve ever played. The imbalance combined with critical bugs makes rotations ineffective and damage output inconsistent.\n\nPay-to-Win Zergfest\nPvP in Throne and Liberty is essentially a game of numbers and money. Guilds with 240+ players, fully geared through pay-to-win mechanics, overwhelm smaller guilds of 50-60 players. There\u2019s zero opportunity to compete for loot or enjoy PvP casually, as the zerg meta completely dominates. Even the arena content, while slightly more enjoyable, suffers from severe class imbalances.\n\nAmazon's Unforgivable Missteps\nThe castle siege event, which I was eagerly looking forward to, was a complete disaster. The developers failed to distinguish defending guilds from attackers, resulting in a chaotic free-for-all. This completely undermined the purpose of the event and turned it into a mess. Even worse, this issue was flagged prior to launch, and Amazon promised a fix\u2014but they delivered nothing.\n\nThis speaks volumes about the game\u2019s future. Within a month of this event, the player base has already dropped by 50%, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised.\n\nRampant Exploits\nTo add insult to injury, it was discovered that entire guilds were using scripts to automatically dodge stuns. Imagine my frustration as a caster, where my only reliable defense is landing a CC ability like Ice Tomb, only for enemies to execute perfect parries or avoid them entirely through cheating. This is unacceptable in any competitive game.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile I won\u2019t deny that I had some fun, the game is marred by critical bugs, unbalanced PvP mechanics, pay-to-win dominance, and rampant cheating.

You can get a companion, a palico, who will quickly become your best buddy and will fight alongside you or provide health during fights. Mine is named Jack-Jack and he is my SON.

[/u] Though for multiplayer (up to 4 players in a quest) it's a lot more complicated, in which you'll have to watch (or most of the time walk to/search and activate) the cutscene before anyone will be able to join you, and since that applies to everyone, you'll either have to leave the quest after watching the cutscene, or have your friend(s) do that instead, which can get annoying. Even with that problem, since monster health scales with the player count, you or your friends shouldn't join too late to ruin a potential first time hunt, if you're [b] not [/b] using Guardian Armor/Defender Weapons in the base game.\nGameplay wise for new players, there's 14 different weapons to choose from, arguably fitting any playstyle you'd have in mind, along with having the option to switch weapons if the one you picked isn't sticking. For the grind for new weapons and armor, unfortunately it could scale from taking only a few hunts of the same monster, to going a whole sitting without getting everything you need. If you're struggling with that, it's best to use the 'Investigation' quests you unlock soon into the game, which is explained in more detail either in game, or a quick internet search.\nTo sum everything up, couldn't suggest this game more from a PvE game lover's standpoint, especially if you have free time on your hands.

Considering if you know the knowledge of the monsters location (which is always in the same place) you can simply go to it. \n\nTo cut to the chase though I stopped playing this game 12 hours in and went over to Rise, which I significantly loved more which makes it hard for me to come back to this game but I definitely eventually will. Rise fixed every annoyance and peeve I had about this game, faster movement, faster climbing, no convoluted hub world that's easy to get around and do what you want to do, no convoluted maps, and generally expanded upon systems. Most importantly, no annoyingly repetitive tracking system that felt like such a chore to go through. I've seen many agree that no tracking is great in Rise, as they also found it time consuming and not fun, generally annoying. I've seen others argue its kinda what makes Monster HUNTER the game. I disagree, though tracking monsters or animals does make a major role in the concept of hunting, it needs to be done way better so I hope if it returns they create a much more fun and interesting system in Wilds which I know nothing about. Otherwise, its for the best that its completely absent in Rise.

Is Fallout but some things went... just wrong, specially story relayed stuff, looting is a little bit worse, and exploration feeling is just not that good.\n\nI waited quite some time to give this a try, convinced that since it was made by Bethesda, had to be good or at least enjoyable, so far i have been beyond dissappointed, it's not complete trash don't get me wrong, but it just gives me the feeling that is more a beta than a game released 1 year ago and has apparently monthly patches. I will try to keep playing it, i really want to like it or at least not let it be a waste of money, paid 70 bucks, and so far feels like an actual rip off.\n\nIMO this game is worth 25 bucks TOPS with all the content released to date, and for what i heared some ppl would rather not even have the dlc, will try to see how that goes eventually.\n\n[i] Makes me nervous, to think that the next Elder Scrolls could appear as something as lame as what they did to this game[/i].\n\nWhen you reach the first city u think to yourself, wow, there must be a ton of stuff going on here, WRONG it's the begining of a completely downhill, inane, and uninteresting experience, it has the feel of an MMO: go talk to X NPC, grab some item/s, go give it to this other NPC, reward. Im not exagerating, i think i did at least 10 missions that where exactly like that. If the rest of the game is like this (yes, there are more incredibly big problems), it honestly should be retired from any shop, as it feels like a just kind of attractive game but with completely insignificant content.\n\nThe moment i tried the building stuff i thought to myself, i guess the Storage tab is different from the Decorations one, but likely it will allow me to, as the ship does, allow me to store stuff with a mass limit NOPE HAHA STORE-WHAT? u place every kind of storage that u would say, ok looks like decoration like the wall closet, it is there, it exists occupies space, but they are solid inside and completely useless. Can u store stuff? yes on a few other containers in the same tab that clearly states that it's content is to STORE STUFF. Furthermore, when you place pretty much anything, u are not told at any time, that you can dismantle everything, getting  all used materials back, which seems like a big oversight, but i kind of rolled with it, the fact that it cannot be aligned to some kind of grid generating from the Outpost or inside a house felt a bit sad, but well u can still place things, right? most of them anyway since apparently a few things always had a problem with colliding with smth that was not there.\n\nHUD... what to say besides pointing out that you can change every control in game but not those from the thing that u use like half of the time, meaning that you open the map with M but when the damn visor is on, you have to use G... what is this Elden Ring? XD\nThe enemy Health Bars half the time are literally between their heads and you, resulting in a very trashy gameplay where you many times don't see their heads, specially with some aliens, huge problem with that that i ended up looking for a mod to get rid of those bars.\nThe compass? i really hope they fired whomever supervised that sh1t, u have a kind of double compass that u cannot properly see that is a compass, since half the time it changes on its own, why not use the external part of the damn circunference? Completely shitty design, made 2 designs and didn't decide, so just why not place both and one of them stops being a compass? it is a clear sign of incompetence right there.\nThe rest of the design just absolute cheap feeling from it, i didn't like that one from Fallout 4 at all, but after this mess i actually missed it.\n\nCombat system... the space will be a fast thing, it suuucks! how it works in general it's like halfway made, it felt like a joke, could be the first ships but, it just sucks.\n0 Gravity Combat, it was kind of fun except for it feeling a liitle clunky sometimes, loved the blowback, and no its not a good idea to try to bat or push with your gun a grenade back to its original user XD\nLand combat, Your average fallout experience but if you touch something a bit elevated from the terrain, will probably make u unable to jump so it was just fallout but worse. The precision percentage is completely fake, crosshairs are irrelevant since they are just appareance, the aiming in general for this to be esentially shooter was very poorly finished.\nIn general it felt half cooked and unbalanced, u don't do much damage in general, or you oneshot beings or foes with extreme ease, and sometimes you end up just killing things that try tu run away but barely moves thing that doesnt sit right with me for some reason.\n\nSound. I literally had headaches due to the sharp sound from the visor and a few other things, way too loud sharp sounds in many but not all interactions. Lot of ppl complained about gun sounds, it was average like the rest of the game so far but enjoyable. Music, completely ear ripping songs from when you level up to some other situations, i had to lower it 3 times because i didn't hear some conversations sometimes. So in general enjoyable but half of it is completely loud, sometimes even literally hurtful.\n\nGraphics. Not bad except for the fact that it just doesn't process as good as it should, some very small structures in open space that were almost literally empty lowered me around 25 fps, not that there was any danger in the ones i visited, but it gets extremely annoying. When you speack to NPCs, half the time the lip and general expression animations suddenly stops, breaking the immersion completely for me. The feel of getting in and out of a planet or a station felt like it was scooped from an indie game the moment u already saw it a few times, and the first was not very impressive either, this happened with pretty much all transitions, funny that the fade to black when using doors to change areas felt more natural hahah\nI messed around with the graphic config, barely made any actual impact but some, soo just another thing to add to my dissappointment pool :'C\n\nControls in general were good, except from the ships, and the poorly explained ship creation? im not even sure of how that goes for now.\n\nInventory? Simply average, usable but no option to mark to sell or trash which for me felt necessary. The fact that to access your ship's vault u have to go to the cockpit is just ridiculous, why cant you access literally from the piece itself where you store your goodies, without having to go in and out the ship? oh wait, because if close enough you can magically teleport it to your storage from your inventory...\n\nHalf the traits and skills felt pretty much useless, i got the parents and the luxury house... u cannot store anything in either one, complete waste of time, the parents at least had some endearing moments. As for the skills some are almot completely irrelevant, hell even the gun skill is mostly useless except a little bit for that last part that increases range 50% and the weight could be a bit better, for both the character and ship, specially if you got the trait to play without companions (isolation i think), no damage increase, almost no utility, even the loot/bartering related have not that much impact.", "hours": 1046, "hoursAtReview": 1046, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733266356}, {"text": "The more I've played Starfield, the more I've liked it, and for the same reasons I enjoy Bethesda's other RPG sandboxes.

I personally hate that they brought back the base building aspect from fallout, it is mostly pointless and boring (much like the rest of the game, sans the following). There was only two good story-lines, that being the Crimson Fleet pirate missions and the Ryujin/thieves-guild-lite quest-lines. However the United Colonies and Freestar Rangers should not allow the player to join both. We should also have seen more friction between those factions or possibly a war questline. The war could have allowed players more influence on the galaxy as there seems to be little on the world at large until after you complete the 'final' mission and start on a New Game+. That NG+ being a absolutely horrible addition to the game and makes the entire game feel even smaller that it is. However it is a double edge sword in that you could start again and not have to make a new character, mind you that is not much of a hassle anyway so the costs outweigh the benefits. \n\nThe number of worlds should have been lowered and more curated and not pre-gen'd as it gives the game world a empty feel. They should have made the game world set farther into the future to give it more life and possibly added alien races to make the game more interesting. Another gripe that I have is on the weapon design. Most are either too chunky looking or if applying any modicum of firearm knowledge would realize that the guns they have made make no sense. I could forget his if the guns had nice designs, however most look uncomfortable to use.\n\nI hope in the future, if a second game is made that they take what most of the community has said to heart and improve the writing, the game-space, and give the player more impact on the world.

Spoiler Alert for Starfield (and Cyberpunk 2077). First spoiler: Starfield sucks. Bethesda has regressed since Skyrim and Fallout, almost as if Starfield was made 10\u201315 years ago.\r\n\r\nTake, for instance, the lack of voice acting for the protagonist. Fallout 4 introduced voiced player responses, which, while not on the same level as Cyberpunk 2077, added an extra layer of immersion. In contrast, Starfield relies solely on text-based responses, and with its already bland and soulless characters, this design choice further strips away any sense of connection or immersion.\r\n\r\nNo swimming? Seriously? Unless this feature is hidden away on some world I haven't visited, the absence of swimming is baffling. Both Skyrim and Fallout had swimming mechanics, and you\u2019d think this would be improved upon in a futuristic setting. Instead, you walk on water like a bad rendering error. Compare this to Cyberpunk, where the underwater sequences\u2014like the one with Judy\u2014are visually stunning and deeply immersive.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things I did in Starfield was jump off a cliff in New Atlantis. I landed safely in water that barely reached my knees. It was underwhelming. Then, I glanced over at a nearby waterfall, and it looked like it was rendered in 8-bit graphics straight out of my first Nintendo console. Is this really what we\u2019re calling \u201cnext-gen\u201d? Even the supposed alternative, spacewalks, is only accessible if you mod it. Bethesda reallly missed an opportunity to create something breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThe technology itself feels outdated. Is it supposed to evoke NASA-like nostalgia? Where are the cyborgs, the synths from Fallout, or teleportation instead of basic fast travel? There\u2019s no advanced AI or immersive AR/VR in how people communicate or share information. It all seems antiquated. We are so close to these technologies today that it seems ridiculous not to have them hundreds of years in the future.\r\n\r\nThe gunplay in Starfield is yet another step backward from the blood-and-guts explosions in Fallout or even the dazzling spells in Skyrim. The physics feel uninspired, and combat lacks the visceral thrill of modern RPGs. Where\u2019s the blood? Where\u2019s the chaos of limbs floating in zero gravity after an intense firefight? Even something as basic as explosions feels sterile. Compare this to the beautifully grotesque carnage of Cyberpunk, where every fight feels impactful, cinematic, and exhilarating.\r\n\r\nOf course, we can\u2019t talk about the lack of violence without mentioning the neutered, sexless world of Starfield. If this is supposed to be a utopian vision, whose utopia is it? Where are the people with green, blue, and red skin? Or futuristic hairstyles? Did the DEI police handcuff your ability to sexualize any of the characters? You can have sexy\u2014look at Cyberpunk. It is filled with all forms of sexual expression, from the clothing everyone wears to the relationships NPCs have with each other. Cyberpunk celebrates sexual diversity and expression at its best, while Starfield delivers a gray and neutered future that no one wants.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another disappointment. It\u2019s dull, lifeless, and fails to evoke the awe of exploring space. A game about the cosmos should feel grand and majestic, but Starfield\u2019s music puts me to sleep\u2014not in the soothing way of ambient space music at 432Hz, but in a monotonous, uninspired way. Contrast this with Cyberpunk\u2019s exceptional soundtrack, which elevates every moment. Just thinking about Lizzy Wizzy\u2019s (Grimes) performance in Phantom Liberty brings tears to my eyes. The sheer emotional resonance of songs like Delicate Weapon leaves Starfield's music in the dust.\r\n\r\nTodd Howard, have you actually played Starfield? Can you see its glaring flaws, or is it just one big blind spot because you\u2019ve been doing the same thing for too long? \r\nTodd Howard, have you played Cyberpunk? Do you see what an RPG can be? It isn't too late to fix Starfield. Cyberpunk was broken\u2014a disaster that CD PROJEKT RED turned around. They listened. They fixed it. They did more than that. They made the best game ever!

I gave it enough time to be sure that [b]I just wasted my money and my time. [/b] A wise move from Techland, creating prologue that will take you roughly 2,5 hours to complete, so you won't be able to refund after you dive in into world full of bugs and missing concepts.\n\n[i]TLDR - if you have any standards, don't follow my mistake, don't give this game a chance and find something better to do. [/i]\n\n[list]\n\n[*] Dialogue options \u2013 why do you create mechanic where I can choose what I want to respond to/talk about, when in 90% of the time I have to go through ALL dialogue options to move to next scene? I feel like a character in a tragic novel \u2013 my choices don\u2019t matter, everything has already been decided by fate\u2026 and I have to pretend to click something. The only moments when you actually choose direction of conversations, are those few where you get 20 seconds for \u2018crucial\u2019 decision. About 1/3 of the way through game I just started to take a glance at subtitles and skip forward. A lot of the conversations are just artificially drawn out and filled with nonsense.\n\n[*] HUD gives you nonsense indicator about opponents - always showing wrong direction, because it's computed as distance/distance from your crosshair, not actual relation character vs opponent. Therefore, you just look at your opponent 10pixel to the side, and indicator will show that somebody is seeing you from the side. Great job guys.\n\n[*] Stealth missions - great way to play when opponents can see through walls or fenced bushes. You can't see them, but they can see you and force you to restart mission from start every freaking time, even on Easy Difficulty. Great job guys.\n\n[*] Stealth missions - using Q (sense of survival) will not mark human opponents at all. You cannot mark them using binoculars, you cannot see them through bushes, so the only way to actually scan environment, is to stand up, stay open, get spotted, see who is where and fail mission, because opponents will not give up to hunt you down (even on Easy mode). \n\n[*] Stealth missions - great idea to add decoys, which you can throw only with full swing, so you either throw it 50m away or bang it 3m from you and get spotted. \n\n[*] DLC missions (Blood lies). While you are cranking any mechanism or pushing a lever, opponents will miss you in 90%. You may just run from Quest point to Quest point, mash 'F' to crank/open something for 20 seconds, zombies next to you will just miss and hit everything else except you. At the end is see this as win - win, I could finish faster this disaster.  \n\n[*] 2022 and it's still too difficult to compute collision model against closing doors. Lovely to see that floating zombies hitting you anyway, because half of their body is blocked in doors, but the other is fully functional.\n\n[*] Enemy special attacks don\u2019t go via collision model. You may stand 2m away and 2m above 'zombie tank' (Goons) and still get hit you through clearly seen obstacle. You may not see opponent, but clearly he can swing his club to kill you, why not.\nVolatile can jump onto you through blocked walls, hit you hard and then magically get back behind wall (rubber band effect), which nor him normally can pass through. Wouldn't care, but game punish you loosing EXP when you die during a night. Great idea to lose 20 minutes of exping only because of bugs.\n\n[*] Polish dubbing, if you cannot afford proper screenwriter/director to adapt dialogs and pace in scenes, please just give up and stick with English. Mood swings of characters during cut scenes are hilarious, except a fact that I paid for this, so at the end I'm the one who is sad. \n\n[*] Models - It's like being in Matrix and seeing agent Smith all around you. Is it so hard to actually prepare mix of models with different clothes? How cool is that when going around any base and see 10 of EXACT same characters in sight. It's freaking 2022, not 2002, you may use my SDD space as you want to store this, it won't bite.\n\n[*] Paraglider, oh boy. It's great that by defaults you set 'W' to dive while gliding, really, bravo. Collision model play its role here also. Why not fly/glide into wall/building and nothing is happening. You may fly towards wall hitting face on it and still slowly and slowly descend like nothing is happening, while character is trying to ascend from time to time. \n\n[*] Animations - you know you can prepare more than one animation for specific action? It's great to see that ALL GRE keys are getting stuck in a same way all over a city, what a surprise. \n\n[*] Animations of opening chests are great, except when character is forced to stand in front of it with safe distance of 1,5m from it, so it just goes into full fire/acid nearby and almost dies. \n\n[*] It's great when side quest on level 1, sends you to facility where 4 Volatiles are just happy hanging around (in day) and 2 of them at night. Great introduce to one of the deadliest zombie opponent when you barely can do anything at this level and die on 2 hits. \n\n[*] Game at best looks like Far Cry 4 (from 2014), I wouldn't care too much if it at least worked well on modern PC (5800X3D with 7800XT). \n\n[*] Small great stuff like catching and hanging from edge, when the edge is actually small concrete road block half meter height.\n\n[/list]", "hours": 1294, "hoursAtReview": 1276, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733251231}, {"text": "DYING LIGHT....

All the way from stealth mechanics to parrying and parkour take downs. You will not need more than half of these things, as the enemies feel so unfair and unbalanced sometimes, you'll mostly just stick to fire mods and explosions or long range weapons to not even engage with the enemy. \n\nThe world in the game is so painfully boring, and the maps feel incomplete for a parkour game (which it is, because you have to basically grind to unlock everything that would make the map feel fun), and the same can be said about the parkour system itself, which locks all the good mechanics behind hours of grinding to get everything you need just to complete the skill tree. Not to mention, by trying too hard to focus on the \"realism\" on the parkour, the game fails at making it feel fun and makes it feel clunky instead.\n\nStorytelling could've been worked on a bit more as well, as the story is so painfully generic and annoying that you'll lose all feeling or care for the characters very quickly, that is if you don't forget them by the time the next story quest comes. It is insane that the story frequently and quickly goes from a very interesting point that is related to the initial quest of the main character, to just randomly making you go find a person that didn't procure an item needed for a story at a different part of town because they're just quirky like that. But now that you found that person, they won't give you that item because they want something in return too, so now you have to beat up some guys at a different part of town.\n\nDying light 2 could've been something amazing. There is some fun elements like the night chases that make it feel exciting to jump around on rooftops to not get caught (although this still takes away from the dread you felt in the first game during the night, because apparently the Volatiles are just that slow and weak now), however there are too many annoying elements like those damn CUSTCENES that you have to load every few seconds just to actually play the game! Need to open this door? Cutscene. Need to speak to the person? Cutscene. They sent you to a different person a few meters behind you? Cutscene. It's so damn annoying, I started wishing the talking stopped already. Not to mention new popup guides coming up every time and stopping you from playing the game because now you have to read all this text for a new item you get every time...\n\nI sincerely wish the developers focus more on the fun element and less on the realism in the future, because this ain't it.\n\n", "hours": 1517, "hoursAtReview": 997, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733873637}, {"text": "The developer just doesn\u2019t get it.

But it\u2019s far too late and far too little.\n\nThe attention to detail is absolutely lacking and often ridiculous.\n\nYou forcefully kick open a metal box in a quiet infiltration at night in a den full of sleeping zombies? Your flashlight is invisible to any other human, zombie, or enemy? Volatiles have unlimited, instant respawn, totally ruining the night stealth mechanic?\n\nAnd the box-opening animation is a world-class disaster. You force open a belt-locked box?

The gameplay loop is incredibly mediocre and quickly turns stale. What once made the first Dying Light so exciting \u2014 fast-paced parkour and intense combat \u2014 is completely lost here. The parkour feels slow and uninspired, and the endless repetition of tasks makes everything feel like a chore. Combat is no better, lacking any real challenge or innovation. The game\u2019s world, which should be exhilarating, just becomes a boring grind, and the lack of meaningful progression only makes it worse.\n\nLaughable Story and Even Worse Boss Fights\nThe story in Dying Light 2 is laughable at best. It\u2019s predictable, full of clich\u00e9s, and lacks any real emotional depth. You won\u2019t find yourself caring about the characters or their motivations, and it feels more like a placeholder than an engaging narrative. The boss fights are even worse \u2014 not only are they uninspired and repetitive, but they\u2019re also frustratingly bad. They don\u2019t offer any sense of accomplishment or challenge, just a reminder of how much better they were in the first game.\n\nHuge Downgrade Compared to Dying Light 1\nCompared to Dying Light 1, this game is a huge downgrade in almost every aspect. The fluid movement, the intense atmosphere, and the rewarding combat that made the first game stand out are all gone. The world feels lifeless, the stakes are nonexistent, and the entire game lacks the sense of danger and excitement that made its predecessor so memorable.\n\nThe Guns Are Completely Useless\nThe guns added in a recent patch are completely useless. They do zero damage, and ammo is extremely scarce, making them a frustrating and ineffective addition. Why bother adding guns if they don\u2019t improve the gameplay in any meaningful way? They feel like a half-hearted attempt to appeal to players, but they\u2019re just another pointless feature that makes the game more frustrating.\n\nThe Paraglider Is the Only Good Addition\nThe only redeeming feature of Dying Light 2 is the paraglider. It\u2019s a fun addition that gives you a new way to explore the world, offering moments of freedom and excitement. But sadly, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s the only good feature in a game full of missed opportunities.\n\nWHY THE FUCK DID THEY REMOVE THE BUGGIES???\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the removal of the buggies. WHY THE FUCK DID THEY REMOVE THE BUGGIES??? They were one of the best parts of the first game, allowing you to travel quickly and adding an extra layer of fun to the gameplay. Now, you\u2019re left walking everywhere, and it feels like a huge step backward. It\u2019s baffling that such a simple but crucial feature was cut from the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Dying Light 2 is a massive disappointment. The gameplay is stale, the story is laughable, and the boss fights are worse than ever. The guns are useless, the buggies are gone, and the only good addition is the paraglider. If you loved the first Dying Light, stay far away from this one.\n\n\"Written by CHATGPT\"", "hours": 2010, "hoursAtReview": 2010, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1734205997}, {"text": "Runs like dogshit and after hours of troubleshooting still runs like dogshit.

The endless should have just been the Flood v2 honestly, but I imagine the next game will try to do something with the endless I guess. The banter between chief and the weapon is fine.. but really the relationship kinda just goes nowhere. At least the pilot is kinda interesting but suffers from in my opinion being too annoying but I see why some people like him. Providing no context as to how Atriox defeated cortanas super death guardians, how atriox even managed to find and blow up the infinity... even dialogue sometimes made me go ??? The weapon says something along the lines of do you have family/anyone and the chief responds with noone or no, like blue team is is family, the remaining spartan 2's are his family. Like we just spent all of Halo 5 playing with them pretty much doing anything and everything together. This game could have been written so much better.\n\nIf you want people to play your game more, look at what made the other games fun. Commit to a storyline and stop changing it when there is backlash to the direction you're wanting to go. If you commit and take the time to explain things, and flesh it out that's fine, don't backpedal and revert everything you tried to do. You also don't have to focus that hard on making games competitive, the game modes outside of ranked playlists should focus on as much fun as possible. Vehicles should be accessible to anyone regardless of KDA or points or whatever it is now. Expand the roster of weaponry and vehicles. Have bigger maps and let people fly pelicans and covenant dropships or whatever. \n\nDon't put the campaign on the backburner in favor of the multiplayer for future titles.", "hours": 5453, "hoursAtReview": 5453, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1734059208}, {"text": "I really like this game.

For example, I built a marksman rogue and got to choosing my third fourth rank up ability. Since one of the previous abilities that I levelled threw poison flasks, and an ability that I was going to choose summoned shadows that where specifically described to throw these flasks. When I got to using it however, they did not.

Wouldn't be a problem if half the gear equipped on him suddenly had nothing to do with his build, and some of the important items were no longer equipable because I'd lost all my Bazaar faction levels.

At the time of my review, the game is 17 years old. It\u2019s a class-based team shooter featuring different game modes: payload, capture the flag, king of the hill, point capture, competitive mode, and notably \u2018MANN vs. MACHINE.\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s amazing is that, even today, I still want to play this game despite it being [u][b]17 years old[/b][/u]. For some reason, it creates a friendly atmosphere, even though its gameplay demands practice and skill. Surprisingly, as a gamer seeking relaxation, I wasn\u2019t discouraged by the skill requirements.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI first discovered this game in my childhood through YouTube videos like \u2018Meet the Team.\u2019 The animated shorts for this game were and remain the best.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI also want to mention that the game is still alive thanks to the community. I think everyone has seen memes featuring characters or music from [b]\u2018Team Fortress 2.\u2019[/b]\u201d\r\n@Popular meme with characters from Team Fortress@\r\nhttps://youtu.be/OXzMdhtzhbc?si=Edd_Mizr7-v3mAuP\r\n\r\n\u201cTo this day, a large number of fan-made videos featuring the game\u2019s characters are being created and will continue to be.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201c[b]\u2018Team Fortress\u2019[/b], specifically \u2018Team Fortress Classic,\u2019 was one of the first class-based shooters to introduce the concept of character classes and unique abilities. Of course, \u2018Team Fortress Classic\u2019 was a mod for \u2018Quake.\u2019 While it had classes, their gameplay was quite similar, and everyone carried the same weapon set. It was in \u2018Team Fortress 2\u2019 that this genre fully developed. Without it, many modern games wouldn\u2019t exist.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSince I mentioned that it\u2019s a class-based shooter requiring skill, let me explain the classes you can choose from.\u201d[/i]\r\n[hr][/hr]\r\n[h2]\u201cMeet the Team\u201d[/h2]\r\n[table]\r\n[tr]\r\n[th]\r\n[list]\r\n\r\n[*][h3]\u201cScout\u201d[/h3]\r\n[quote=Scout]\u201cUm...

Last I played(and I heard) that for example the ai in sieges still keeps getting stuck in places so reinforcements don't man the walls and such or troops on both sides running back and forth to push down/raise the ladders again, combat was the main feature of Warband which compensated for the other flaws but even that does not work properly in Bannerlord. And of course said tiny patches break whatever mods one has at the time(yeah, can rollback/stay on specific versions but I imagine it takes it's toll on the modders interest).\n\nLords have even less personality than in Warband, politics are even more shallow, the new skill/perk system offers perks that do pretty much nothing, the criminal/gang system seems like it was abandoned half way, blacksmithing restricted to weapons only...I could go on, short version is even more half complete ideas than in Warband but at least Warband was a decent base and the complete overhaul mods put it to good use and fixed it as far as possible and as much as the old engine could take it.\n\nReally wondering where all that dev time went, ~10 years to release it and with beta testing/early access and this is still what we got. What happened Taleworlds?\n\nIt's back to Pendor or Perisno in Warband if I can find the mood for it again, Bannerlord needs a wonder to get truly completed, handed over to a more motivated studio or just sell the engine so someone else can make a proper sequel/spinoff from the bones of it.\n\n*sigh* yeah, I had high hopes for this if you still couldn't tell.", "hours": 8653, "hoursAtReview": 8653, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733856914}, {"text": "Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord struggles to live up to its potential as a true sandbox experience, especially when it comes to supporting the extensive modding community that has long been a hallmark of the series.

New players are often met with verbal abuse, griefing, or outright hostility from more experienced players. The voice chat is riddled with foul language and offensive remarks, and the lack of effective moderation means this behavior often goes unchecked. If you're looking for a welcoming gaming environment, Rust is definitely not the place to find it.\nFor new players, Rust is nothing short of a nightmare. The game provides minimal guidance, leaving newcomers to stumble through its complex mechanics. The learning curve is steep to the point of being discouraging, and you'll likely spend your first several hours being killed repeatedly without understanding why. Veteran players with thousands of hours in the game dominate servers, and they have no qualms about bullying less experienced players for fun. The lack of matchmaking or beginner-friendly servers exacerbates this issue.\nWhile some players might enjoy the grind, for others, it feels like a complete waste of time. Harvesting resources takes forever, especially when you're repeatedly killed before you can secure them. Building a base is a time-consuming task, and just as you\u2019re starting to make progress, you\u2019ll likely be raided by players with far superior gear. The constant cycle of building, gathering, and losing everything feels more like a chore than an enjoyable gaming experience.\nPvP in Rust is laughably one-sided. Newer players with primitive weapons stand no chance against clans armed with fully automatic rifles and explosives. Combat boils down to who has the better gear, not who has the better skills. This imbalance makes the game feel incredibly unfair, especially when you realize that the best equipment is often locked behind hours of grinding or collaboration with large groups.\nRaiding, a core mechanic in Rust, feels disproportionately punishing. No matter how well you fortify your base, determined players will always find a way to break in, especially if they have access to end-game explosives. Losing everything you\u2019ve worked for while offline is demoralizing, and the inability to effectively defend your base while you're not online means the game often punishes players for having lives outside of gaming.\nRust demands a huge time investment, but rarely does it feel rewarding. To succeed, you need to dedicate countless hours to gathering resources, maintaining your base, and defending it from attackers. For casual players, this is simply unsustainable. The game's focus on \"survival\" quickly turns into a second job, and the payoff rarely justifies the effort.\nDespite years of updates, Rust is still riddled with bugs and technical issues. Hit detection in combat feels inconsistent, server desync is a frequent annoyance, and players often experience lag or frame drops, even on high-end systems. These technical shortcomings are especially frustrating during critical moments, like PvP encounters or base defenses, where a single glitch can mean the difference between success and failure.\nIf you\u2019re not part of a large, organized clan, don\u2019t expect to survive for long. Clans dominate every aspect of Rust, from resource collection to PvP. Solo players and small groups are constantly overshadowed, outnumbered, and outgunned by massive groups of players who operate with military precision. This disparity makes Rust feel like an exclusive club for hardcore clan players, with little room for anyone else.\nDespite its relatively simplistic graphics, Rust is poorly optimized. Even powerful gaming PCs struggle to maintain stable performance, especially on densely populated servers. Loading times are excessively long, textures often fail to render correctly, and the game has a tendency to crash at the most inconvenient times. For a game that\u2019s been out for years, these issues are inexcusable.\nOnce you\u2019ve played Rust for a while, the gameplay loop becomes painfully repetitive. Gather resources, build a base, get raided, repeat. The lack of meaningful progression or variety makes the game feel like an endless grind. While updates occasionally add new features, they rarely address the core issues that make the game feel stale over time.\nThe developers of Rust have a reputation for being dismissive of player feedback. Updates often prioritize adding flashy new features over fixing longstanding bugs or addressing community concerns. This lack of transparency and responsiveness from the dev team makes it hard to believe they genuinely care about improving the player experience.\nAt its current price point, Rust feels overpriced, especially given its glaring flaws. The game\u2019s reliance on player-hosted servers means you\u2019ll often need to spend additional money on server subscriptions or deal with poorly managed servers. Combined with the grindy, punishing gameplay, Rust fails to deliver value for its cost.\nIn conclusion, Rust had the potential to be a great game, but its glaring flaws make it an exercise in frustration rather than fun. Between the toxic community, steep learning curve, grindy mechanics, unbalanced PvP, and technical issues, it\u2019s hard to recommend Rust to anyone but the most masochistic of gamers. If you value your time, sanity, or overall gaming enjoyment, there are far better survival games out there. Rust may be popular, but popularity doesn't always equal quality. Proceed with caution\u2014or better yet, avoid it altogether.\n\nanyway if you read this far tobias has a giant ass nose, like hal from angry birds big", "hours": 9422, "hoursAtReview": 7374, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731887500}, {"text": "I love the combination of survival and first person shooter.

Developed by the team at Lethal Games, the title invites players into dark, eerie locations filled with supernatural threats, where teamwork and communication are key to surviving the terror lurking around every corner. What sets Lethal Company apart from many other horror games is its emphasis on cooperative gameplay, making it an incredibly fun and engaging experience when played with friends.\r\n\r\nThe game takes place in a variety of eerie settings, such as abandoned buildings, haunted hotels, and rundown mansions. The environment is wonderfully atmospheric, with dark corridors, flickering lights, and strange noises that keep players on edge. The game's sound design is particularly effective in heightening tension\u2014every creak, thud, and distant whisper feels unnerving, and it's easy to get drawn into the game's world. The visuals, while not hyper-realistic, have a unique, somewhat gritty style that complements the horror theme well, focusing more on mood than high-end graphics. This creates an unsettling vibe that makes you feel like something could jump out at any moment.\r\n\r\nAt its core, Lethal Company revolves around exploration and survival, but it stands out from other horror titles with its heavy reliance on teamwork. Players are tasked with investigating various haunted locations, searching for clues, and solving puzzles to progress while avoiding or outsmarting terrifying entities that roam the area. The catch is that the game doesn't handhold you through these tasks\u2014you need to work together with your friends to figure out what's happening and how to escape. This reliance on cooperation makes it much more fun when played with others, as every decision becomes a group effort, and everyone must rely on each other to make it out alive.\r\n\r\nThe horror elements in Lethal Company are both thrilling and unpredictable. The enemies you encounter are genuinely terrifying, with some appearing suddenly to chase you down, while others may only make their presence known through subtle environmental cues. This unpredictability adds to the tension, as players are never entirely sure what to expect. The AI-controlled threats don't follow set patterns, meaning that each playthrough feels fresh and challenging. The jump scares, while occasional, are used sparingly and effectively, keeping the gameplay tense without overdoing it.\r\n\r\nWhat really makes Lethal Company shine, however, is its social aspect. When playing with friends, the game becomes an emotional rollercoaster. The fear is real, but the camaraderie that develops as players work together to survive is what makes the experience truly memorable. The dynamic between players shifts from strategic cooperation to sheer panic, and the moments when everything falls apart\u2014when someone gets separated or dragged away by a monster\u2014are both terrifying and hilarious. The shared experience of overcoming the game's many obstacles, whether it's escaping a monster or solving a particularly tricky puzzle, creates an emotional bond that adds a lot of fun to the gameplay.\r\n\r\nWhile Lethal Company offers a highly enjoyable and thrilling experience with friends, it\u2019s not without its faults. Some may find the mechanics a bit repetitive after several playthroughs, as the puzzles and objectives can feel similar. Additionally, the game\u2019s reliance on voice chat for coordination can be a bit challenging for those without a strong internet connection or who prefer not to use a mic. Despite these minor drawbacks, the game's overall appeal, particularly when played in a group, is undeniable. Whether you're a fan of horror games or just looking for a fun time with friends, Lethal Company provides a compelling, adrenaline-pumping experience that is sure to leave you both terrified and entertained.", "hours": 2364, "hoursAtReview": 2244, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733186681}, {"text": "This is one of the best horror games I have ever played.

It's not just a farming simulator; it's a life simulator\u2014because who needs real-life responsibilities when you can grow virtual watermelons?\r\n\r\nAt first, the game lures you in with its pixelated charm and relaxing vibes. \"It\u2019s so peaceful,\" you think as you plant your crops. Then, reality hits: you\u2019re broke, Pierre is overcharging for seeds, and some drunk guy just called you a loser at the bar. Before long, you're grinding in the mines at 2 a.m., desperately trying to find iron so you can upgrade your watering can before summer. And don\u2019t get me started on the fishing mini-game, which is less \u201crelaxing pastime\u201d and more \u201cDark Souls with a rod.\u201d\r\n\r\nRelationships in Stardew are another level of emotional manipulation. You can spend months wooing a villager, gifting them precious amethysts and perfectly cooked meals, only for them to say, \"Thanks, but I don't really like this.\" Excuse me, Haley, that diamond was worth more than your entire personality. But hey, it's all worth it when you finally get a reluctant \"I guess you're okay\" at two hearts. At least Abigail appreciates the amethyst, in her own way of course.\r\n\r\nThe Community Center is where things truly spiral. Instead of enjoying your idyllic farm life, you're now a slave to the Junimos, grinding to find one random crop you need or a duck feather to appease their capitalist agenda. Sure, you could sell out to JojaMart and save yourself the pain, but then you'd lose the moral high ground\u2014and what\u2019s the point of playing Stardew without your farmer pride?\r\n\r\nIn short, Stardew Valley is the perfect mix of cozy escapism and existential farming dread.

The ability to manipulate monsters into fighting each other is a particular highlight and its always satisfying to dig in some great damage on a target by using the other local wildlife against it. I like the monster line-up as well. There are some old favorites that didn't appear in world along with new faces that really show off what the monster hunter team can do. The environments are also really nice and are generally a highlight of the game. That being said, there are some aspects of this game that I think ruin what I value about Monster Hunter.\n\nThe wire bugs make the game laughably easy. They are strong in just about every aspect and this makes it easy to spam them to get a higher DPS. They aren't exactly skillful, they just feel like a crutch that allows you to circumvent actually learning your weapon. A lot of survival elements also seem nerfed into baby mode. My stamina felt bottomless when I wasn't running up walls and status effects felt like a non-issue with how strong your pets are during hunts. This is especially true for multiplayer where everyone can still bring their primary companion to help them even with a 4-person party. Gathering has been made even easier and the environments have so many elevated areas that you are practically always within wirebug distance of a safe area to heal sharpen your weapons. The difficulty is just at a point where many mechanics are nullified with nothing substantial to replace them.\n\nI still think Monster Hunter Rise is worth your time.

I have been playing Path of Exile since June of 2012 http://i.imgur.com/jeP6URF.png and have thousands of hours on it.[/h1]\n\nIt is among the most amazingly awesome games I have ever played. Coming from Diablo 2: LoD, and the various mods (Valhalla, Eastern Sun, Median, etc) this game is perfect for me. \n\n* I will start here, with the things that I enjoy about it.\n\n1. Diversity among builds. Want to shoot a thousand exploding arrows per second (Quill Rain + Chain/Greater Multiple Projectiles/Exploding Arrow/Fire Penetration)? Want to blast rays of fire that launch exploding balls of magma (Scorching Ray/Cast While Channeling/ Fire Penetration/ Multiple Projectiles/Magma Orb)? Want to call forth the fury of the heavens with a mighty scepter, smashing your foes into submission (Mjolnir+ Lightning Strike/Arc/StormCall/Spark/Multistrike)? The sheer amount of ways you can go about destroying mobs is limited only to your imagination. \n\n2. Story is great, very interestnig, and keeps you entertaining while playing through the game. Unlike other ARPGS of similar play style, Path of Exile is able to effectively deliver a quality story along with the extremely well done gameplay.\n\n3. Scenery is dark and grim, gloomy, morbid, and full of gore. From corpse ridden beaches, ancient temples filled with undead and skeletons, destitute crumbling cities, palace cellars flooded with blood - ridden with heaps of corpses and twisted miscreations, echocing crystal caverns of golems and mutated freaks. The variety in enemies and terrain is very broad. \n\n4. Item creation, map alteration and creation, uber dungeons. There is plenty of challenge to be had in this game, thus keeping you striving to achieve ever greater power and push yourself ot the absolute limits of your capabilities.\n\n5. Infinite replayablity. I have made probably 50+ characters so far, and each one gets progressively more powerful as I understand more about the game, the mechanics, and how to build them effectively. \n\n6. Temp Leagues + Ladder. Nuff said.\n\n7. Constant expansion and content updates. The game is constantly being updated, minor balance tweaks, additional items, skills, monsters, maps, etc. It's amazing.\n\n8. Grinding Gear Games are among the most amazing gaming company. Really really good people and they constantly interact and have dialogue with the playerbase. \"How do you guys feel about X? Does Y feel right to you? If you could change X, what would you do and why?\" etc.\n\n[b]I could go on for another thousand lines but I feel as though I got the point across. The game is amazingly fun and addicting.[/b]\n\n[h1]Now, for the things that, I don't necessarily \"dislike\" - but things that I feel may dissuade other people from playing the game.[/h1]\n\n1. Learning Curve is incredibly steep. Your first 3-5 characters will be absolute trash. You need to do a bit of research on what to do and how to build effectively, otherwise you're probably going to get wrecked hard once you get to a4 merciless. Here is a beginners guide - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEZtq6FSebE&list=PLjlRwdIo6SixoG_Bo5bhKCzZtOMVuVnJZ&index=8&t=8s\n\n2. Repetition of acts, 3 difficulties (however, this will be gone come July - TEN ACTS ONE PLAYTHROUGH HYPE!) Going from Normal, to Cruel, and then to Merciless can really put people off. Myself, I'm used to it and have done it since d2 so it's just a normal thing for the arpg genre. GGG are going to change that though.\n\n3. Item crafting is [b]extremely[/b] expensive. Like, unfathomably expensive. I have never crafted an item before other than throwing an alch and a couple chaos into a rare item. \n\n4. Currency is nightmarishly rare. I've found maybe 4 exalted orbs in my entire time playing this game. Two of them were just within the last week as well. I have only ever owned two 6-link items. Wings of Entropy, and some random rare 2h sword that is garbage. \n\n5. poe.trade is the only real way to trade. $Chat is a scam 100% of the time. Once they implement a real trading system other than posting shops online and checking the forums every 3 minutes, or browsing poe.trade for an hour at a time trying to find an item to fill a hole in your build this game will be just shy of perfection.\n\nThose are really the only negative things I can think of that might dissuade a player from sticking around... the game is magnificent.\n\nI highly, highly suggest you play.\n\n[h1]Overall Rating[h1]\n[b]10/10 - one of my favorite games of all time.[/b]", "hours": 47927, "hoursAtReview": 1682, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1487830856}, {"text": "Random Lazy Review (SP):\n\nThis game may be inspired heavily by diablo 2 but presented a pinnacle of greatness out of itself.\n\n+ One handed easy to play isometric hack and slash worldwide standard.\n+ Main storyline, missions are decent enough.\n+ Every single game mechanic is perfected to the extremes.\n+ Huge skill tree, interesting gem properties resulting in brilliant active skills.\n+ Artistic/Graphical side and variety of characters, enemies, landscapes etc. are a sight for sore eyes\n\n\nSome of minor issues \"for me\" which has no effect on the value fo the game:\n- Where is the pause button?

You can also level up those skills too. \n\nThe gameplay is addicting and fun. Party up or solo its a great experience. Skills are unique and fun to use and mod, and the addition of 5 potion slots makes it even more vaied. \n\nThe developers really know ARPG's. They listen to the community and make smart decisions with balance, gameplay, and how items/currency work. They give you plenty of freedom with items that can customize your gear so you have lots of room to make something you want work.

And honestly, while the game has its moments, it falls short in too many areas.\n\nGraphics (9/10): The visuals are fantastic well-crafted environments and solid spell effects. It could\u2019ve used more creativity in the spell designs, but that\u2019s a minor complaint.\n\nCombat (8/10): Combat is fun and engaging, especially with the synergy between party members. It's not groundbreaking, but it gets the job done well.\n\nEnemy Variety (2/10): This is a huge letdown. The game recycles the same enemies over and over\u2014goblins, cyclopes, drakes. It felt repetitive compared to other RPGs like Elden Ring or Skyrim, which offer way more variety.\n\nPawns (0/10): Pawns are the most annoying part of this game. Their constant chatter, falling off cliffs, and repetitive dialogue ruined the immersion for me. Having to constantly rehire them based on my level only made things worse.\n\nExploration (1/10): Exploration is a slog. No fast travel, constant enemy encounters, and finding gear that\u2019s worse than what shops sell makes wandering around feel pointless.\n\nSide Quests (5/10): A lot of side quests are just fetch or escort tasks, but there are a few that are interesting. Still, nothing that stands out compared to other open-world RPGs.\n\nMain Quest (3.5/10): The main story is flat and mostly just fetch quests. The plot twists are confusing, and there\u2019s no emotional connection to the narrative.\n\nOverall (4/10): Despite the solid combat and good visuals, Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2 feels stuck in the past. It lacks modern features like fast travel and quality-of-life improvements, making it feel outdated compared to more recent RPGs.

The creatures are beautiful and the combat is incredible, which might make you want to keep playing.\nI admit that I wanted much more in terms of story and multiplayer interaction - even though, deep down, I knew it wouldn't be any different.\nOverall, the unique orbital developments to the main story are very weak, where the quests were developed in somewhat dubious ways. I say that the game captured the essence of the previous one, but the need for something new left the game a little out of place.\nStill, it's one of - if not the - combat in a game that I like most, Dragon's Dogma has always had and will always have a special place in my memory.

I was hyped for this game, I thought it was going to be better than Dark Arisen, one of my favorite games ever, I thought this game was going to be a game of the year game, and honestly, it fails in every regard, being even worse the base Dragon's Dogma. I have never felt more disappointed in a game than this game alone.\n\nTo be fair, and unbiased, let us go over the good of this game\nIt has more unique weapons for melee combat and the animations of the game are amazing, hands down. The game looks great and the character customization is great as well, honestly I had a great time making characters and pawns. There is more environments to explore compared to Dragon's Dogma 1, \n\nLets get onto the many flaws and issues of the game, as well as its many shortcomings\nThe combat feels more, or rather less, engaging. I do feel as if very few skills are limiting, mostly for magic classes that and the limitations of a single weapon. Even the lack of some unique combos or strings for some of the weapons is also a downer, and while they did make a boring weapon such as the greatsword, better with just frame techniques, it fails to make it up with other weapons and Vocations. \nThere is also just weak Vocations, examples being mages being more limiting and boring to play, don't get me started on the Trickster, which I will be honest, is a very weak and boring class to play, and would better for a Pawn to play instead. Spoilers the last class and the best and somewhat worse class, the Warfarer, which allows you to use all of the equipment in the game, but the flaw comes with the limit of skills, making most weapons or builds generally useless sadly.\nI will not talk about performance, even my system was not expected to run the game at the quality i was forcing it at a stable frame rate, but I will not deny that the game struggles so much to run even dropping to 10 frames or lower in the city or even battles at lower settings to balance it out. The game is a nightmare to run perfectly most of the time, and its a marvel that it can work sometimes, but its still not optimal.\nThe combat suffers so I thought the story would at least be a step up, sadly from what I've played, and what I've heard, it is not good. Honestly I was not expecting much, but I wanted it to be good at least.\nFinal note on the combat, I do say that the gameplay suffers the most from the same repeated encounters and large monsters, to the point its an extreme detriment to the flow of not only combat, but exploration as well, something that makes the game a hassle to enjoy most of the time. if the encounter rate was lowered, or if there was more unique creatures to fight, then this might have not been a major issue at all, but this makes it very hard to enjoy these gameplay features.\nThe health system. My lord the health system. While I do honestly think the that pausing the game and allowing you to gain back recoverable and non-recoverable health in DDDA was pretty broken, and they could have done better with this system. It is more of a nuisance rather than actual fun gameplay trying to manage the health and non-recoverable health.\n\nI came in expecting a very good game, only to be left with a a massive disappointment and honestly, a game feels as if it is a tech demo rather than an enjoyable and fun game. I don't believe a DLC or a massive Update will change the game for the better. Honest a new game from the ground up might be better than DLC or updates personally, the flaws are so baked into the game, I can not imagine even trying to iron or tweak these without making a new game. I wanted this game to be fun, I wanted it to blow my socks off, I wanted it to be my game of the year, but it just falls completely short of everything, leaving me empty and just sad with the final product.\n\nDo I recommend this, no, 100% buy Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen and have a much more fun, and enjoyable experience. Its smaller, it may have less customization, but the gameplay, game feel, and more freedom with how you want to build your character and pawn in gameplay is 100% more enjoyable and freeing.

Capcom took a step into the action-adventure format, and the game had some pretty revolutionary mechanics specifically in regards to combat, a great NPC follower/party system, and a great open world to explore with many nooks and crannies to delve into. Sure, it lacked story telling, presentation, polishing... but these shortcomings were forgivable (at least to me) because the game was not one of their priority titles, and maybe they were testing the waters.\n\nCut to 2024, the year of DD2's release. Capcom is absolutely booming. They have released Monster Hunter World, their most successful game to date, and the also very successful Street Fighter 6. It is clear that Capcom knows how to make some solid, high quality games. In Monster Hunter's case especially, World was almost an entire overhaul of the series. They cast aside many of the previous/classic mechanics of Monster Hunter to bring a refreshing, faster paced and more dynamic game to their players. Combat was overhauled, gathering, story telling, graphics, monsters, multiplayer and more... As a legacy player, I felt 99% of these changes in MH:World were an outright improvement to the series. Surely Capcom give Dragon's Dogma atleast a fraction of that same love, right?\n\nNo. Combat stayed largely the same, graphics were improved (albeit hard for most rigs to run), character creator still good, enemies are largely the same, storytelling is still janky, basic save options (only one save file), no multiplayer, quests are basic and non-intuitive, vocations are unbalanced. What did they really improve upon? What does DD2 offer that DD:DA does not? I feel that Capcom would have been better off remastering and modernizing Dark Arisen than spending resources on its 'prettier', underdeveloped, more expensive doppelganger. To top it off, they made DD2 pre-orderable and added micro-transactions.\n\nPlayers have had the privilege of playing some AMAZING action-adventure titles such as- Nintendo's Breath of the Wild/Tears of the Kingdom, Guerilla Games' Horizon Zero Dawn, Warhorse Studios' Kingdom Come: Deliverance, CD Project's Witcher and Red Dead Redemption Series. There are more titles, but my point being these games have all contributed greatly to the Action-Adventure genre and set a high bar amongst AAA studio game developer/publishers, and it saddens me that Capcom did not meet or push this bar higher.\n\nYou can see from my hours played that I did put time into the game, and I did have fun. It is an overall okay game. It is just frustrating that other games, even titles from Capcom, have offered a much higher quality, much more polished product for a more affordable price point.\n\nTLDR; Good game but lacks a lot of the modern upgrades and polish of other games, so it is not for everyone and therefore I would not recommend.

Turns out there are boss fights on this cart ride.  Also turns out you lose max health cap every time you die and the only regular save was auto created on the cart right before the boss fights.  Tried that for a while.  Beating my head against it with a silver of health.  Got close once and a second boss magically joined because the game loves me.  Finally decided after wasting a bunch of time to use the inn save which was the only other option.  Turns out I had not rested at an inn so it deleted my other save and put me back at the beginning of the game.\n\nThe point of a game is not to invent ways to waste peoples time.

Didn't even finish it halfway as I found the gameplay to quickly get repetitive and boring. When Space Marine 2 was announced, I was less psyched than my friends but ended up [b]enjoying it the most[/b].\n\nWhether you're a fan of WH40k or not, you will no doubt find the gameplay enjoyable. It revolves around [b]reaction skills, tactical thinking and teamwork[/b]. Doesn't that sound awesome already?\n\nDuring the game you use a combination of both Melee and Ranged weapons. At times it may feel like it leans more towards melee, but it's really dependent on the situation you place yourself in.\n\nThe game has 3 modes:\n[list]\n[*] Campaign (single/can be played up to 3 players)\n[*] Operations (focused on co-op)\n[*] Eternal War (PVP)\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Campaign[/h1]\nThe campaign is enjoyable. You visit different locations, fight 2 enemy factions, get to see the chemistry between the characters and enjoy a story unraveled before you. The only con is that it can feel too short. But hey, I enjoyed this campaign much more than all those stupid open world games that stop your progression with side quests and other garbage just to extend their playtime, leading to a long but trash experience. Space Marine 2 goes old school, giving you a shorter but high quality campaign which I personally prefer because Operations mode picks up the rest.\n\n\n[h1]Operations[/h1]\nThis is where the most fun is at. Operation has 3 players take on missions that happen parallel to the main campaign. Here you pick from a selection of 5 classes to play (no duplicates allowed in lobby):\n[list]\n[*] [b]Tactical:[/b] Your standard space marine, mixing both melee and ranged with a versatile arsenal.\n[*] [b]Assault:[/b] Focused on melee and having access to the thunder hammer, this class is great for crowd control and can maneuver out of danger.\n[*] [b]Vanguard:[/b] Focused more on melee and high precision bolters, able to Grapple himself towards enemies for maneuverability and tactical play, quickly getting to the high priority targets.\n[*] [b]Bulwark:[/b] Armed with melee and shield (only class to have shield), focused on Melee and keeping the team standing with his ability to plant a banner which quickly regenerates shield for those within range and at max level can help them regain lost health.\n[*] [b]Sniper:[/b] Only class to have access to the sniper rifles, focused on taking down dangerous and high priority targets in the midst of chaos and staying alive through cloak.\n[*] [b]Heavy:[/b] Using either of the three heavy weapons (Heavy Bolter, Multi-Melta and Heavy Plasma Incinerator) he can lay down heavy fire on the enemies, being able to focus on crowd control or high single-target damage based on setup.\n[/list]\n\nYou can choose between 5 different difficulties to play, from the easiest to the hardest and endgame revolves around you playing hardest difficulty, leveling all your classes and guns. Here, teamwork is essential. You cannot lone wolf the whole thing and the better you play as a team, the easier it will be.\n\n\n[h1]Eternal War[/h1]\nUnfortunately for this part I don't have much good to say. PVP is a 6vs6 match with 3 game modes, 1 is annihilation which is focused mainly on killing the enemy team while the other two game modes are focused on capturing points and holding them.\nYou are again able to pick from the 5 classes however you cannot upgrade your gear. Everyone plays on the same level. A new player will be able to dish out the same amount of damage as a veteran, so it all comes down to skill and teamplay.\n\nThe unfortunate part is that currently there are only 3 maps to play on. [b]There isn't an auto-balance system[/b] so even after a match ends and a team has dominated the other, the players are not scrambled between the two teams and instead everything stays the same which leaves no option but to leave and queue for another match.\n\nFrankly I must say that if you're planning to buy this only for the PVP, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\n\n[h1]Now for the ugly[/h1]\nThere are a few major cons about this game that can get frustrating.\n[list]\n[*] [b]Connection Problems[/b]\nThe campaign has the worst connection problems of all, at times making a joining player have 500 ping despite all players being in the same region. Simply trying to connect to your friend can also take 10 minutes as you have to constantly retry with different methods.\nIn Operations, it's much better, but you will still see your fair share of losing connection during Joining, or ending up in a match with too high of a ping for you.\n[u]I have not seen any problems in PVP however.[/u]\n\n[*] [b]Operations Duplicate Class[/b]\nAs mentioned, you cannot pick duplicate classes in Operations which is a good thing. The bad part about it is that when you've picked a class and are searching for matches, the game cares more about finding you a match quickly rather than prioritizing your class, so there is a 25% chance that the match you join will already have your desired class and you'll be forced to play another.\n\n[*] [b]Endgame will eventually run out[/b]\nOperations only has 7 missions so far (another one coming rin December). [b]Because similar to Left 4 Dead, Ready or Not and other games you can play the same maps and have different experiences each time, it's not as bad as some players make it sound[/b]. I've played 131 hours so far and still want to play more as I still have 2 classes and many guns to max.\nHowever, at this rate, eventually one day the content will run out for me. The best thing would be to add Mutators/Modifers that add or change systems for missions. It can either change per week or match, much like how Star Craft 2's co-op did. Unfortunately, the devs have not talked about anything similar to this publicly so it's possible it might never happen. So in a sense, there will be a point where you'll get bored of the game. You may play 60 hours and leave like some, or 131 like me and still play, or play +400 hours like some players. Depends on who you are.\n[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAll in all, if you're here for the co-op and are looking for a skill-based game, you're going to have a blast! [b]I would highly recommend it in that manner.[/b]\nIf you're here for the PVP only, then I suggest you do some proper research.\n\nIs it worth 60$? For me it was.

It is like taking a time machine back to the 2010s and going through all those beautifully made games during that era. It also shows how far AAA gaming has fallen. All publishers and development teams should take note and do better, focusing primarily on player experience over 'sending the message' and monetization. Saber Interactive should be very proud of what they have made. \n\nIf, like me, you are disappointed with the needless disrespect towards canon and established lore by Games Workshop lately, then you need not fear Space Marine 2. Space Marine 2 follows the story of Captain Titus in a way that respects what has been and does not cater to the tourists and nu-Warhammer fans destroying the hobby currently. Any true Warhammer fans can buy Space Marine 2 guilt-free.\n\nThe single-player campaign is long enough to provide a story that ties into the Era Indomitus and the previous story of the first Space Marine game. Playing it solo can be challenging, especially on higher difficulties, but I found it to be well worth playing and had very few issues with it even though I finished it on early patches. \n\nPlaying Operations solo is also likewise a very meaningful experience that you cannot replicate elsewhere. I am ecstatic that Saber Interactive is continuing to develop more missions for this mode. The mission where you kill the Bio-Titan is my new favourite. I have had a few drops when I played it, but otherwise, I have not had any major issues.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, but I still think the Bulwark class is overpowered, and some balancing is necessary. It is not a mode I have played a ton, but I can report no major issues. \n\nA huge bonus is that the usual suspects hate Space Marine 2 and its success:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4qeAeEMVCc\n\nAnother bonus is that the CEO of Saber Interactive is incredibly based:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXL1f00Yw6U\n\nAs is some of their dev team:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCbfQf7bPGg\n\nI give Space Marine 2 a very solid 9/10, only citing some minor technical issues in Operations mode.

The galaxies shimmer with new possibilities! The once-lonely stars are now populated with bustling settlements, strange and wondrous lifeforms, and even robotic civilizations that whisper secrets of a lost age.

One moment, you\u2019re piloting a ship crafted from alien organic tissue, its every sinew alive beneath your hands. The next, you\u2019re reeling in exotic aquatic life from the ocean\u2019s depths. You\u2019re chasing the mysteries of a derelict freighter one day and defending settlements from marauding sentinels the next.

Planets are more vibrant, their clouds and water so detailed you\u2019ll swear you feel the chill of alien winds or the spray of otherworldly oceans. And then there are the skies! By the stars, they blaze with colors that seem to bleed through the screen, each sunrise and nebula a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nCombat? Sharper, smarter, and more strategic. From the overhaul of sentinel encounters to the introduction of outlaw dreadnoughts, battles now feel like the epic dogfights we\u2019ve only dreamed of in our sci-fi fantasies.

No Man's Sky doesn\u2019t just invite you to explore\u2014it demands it. It needs you to see what it has become. And believe me, traveler, you\u2019ll want to answer that call.

Explore the galaxy and strip out all the resources, or catalog all the fauna and flora. Learn alien languages, do fishing, cook.\n\nAs NMS is bit of everything, individual activities usually have barely enough depth to make them interesting. In fishing for example you can create lures for different situations. The actual fishing is basically test of being awake when the fish is caught. You can release or sell the fish and there's also catalog what you have found. So not a in depth fishing game, but if feel like you want to catch them all, you can spent quite lot of time for finishing your collection.\n\nThere's also some lore and plot. Main plot is bit though provoking and I think it consists of two mission chains. Lore is all over the place though you can get some surface level understanding of history if you know where to look for the lore.\n\nSo all in all, some jank, but there's lot to do if you can tolerate some grinding (when you understand the game better, there are possibilities to reduce the grind).

I've built trashy shacks on airless worlds and palaces on the beaches of paradise. I've travelled through wormholes, between galaxies, and jumped my ships over countless light years. I've discovered and named hundreds of solar systems  and their planets, animals, plants, and minerals. I've learned new languages, slowly deciphered the secrets of the universe and... kicked back and gone fishing.\n\nI've watched as the game continues to evolve - and it gets better and better.

So, here I am, starting fresh on PC, ready to soak in the game\u2019s full glory, and oh boy, it\u2019s been an absolute treat to dive back in!\n\nFirst off, the sheer amount of content in this game is bananas. Want to become a space pirate? Go for it. Prefer terraforming a paradise planet? Have at it. Or maybe you\u2019re more into cataloging weird alien creatures that look like a cross between a giraffe and a toaster? The galaxy is literally your playground. There\u2019s so much to do that the biggest challenge is deciding what to focus on (Spoiler: I mostly just run around marveling at the scenery like a space tourist with no schedule)\n\nThis time around, I\u2019m super hyped to try playing with a friend. I\u2019ve never experienced the multiplayer side of No Man's Sky, but the idea of building a base together or co-piloting a fleet sounds like pure chaos in the best way possible. Oh, and don\u2019t even get me started on expeditions - they\u2019re calling my name, and I can\u2019t wait to see what wild scenarios they throw at me.\n\nA massive shoutout to the developers, by the way. It\u2019s so heartwarming to see the game now rocking a Very Positive/Overwhelmingly Positive rating on Steam - it\u2019s completely deserved. Hello Games took what could\u2019ve been a galaxy-sized flop and turned it into an interstellar masterpiece. Seriously, hats off to them.\n\nTL;DR: No Man's Sky is like a good wine - it just gets better with time. Whether you\u2019re a returning player like me or jumping in for the first time, it\u2019s a blast.

Beside the amazing story that you can discover in fragments scattered all over the world, the game offers a lot of fun for long hours. At first it can be a bit overwhelming because there is so much to do and you constantly have to think about survival, but later it can be really relaxing. I like that the game gives you the choice of how you want to play... building income from mining factories, or maybe by crafting valuable goods, or just trading rare artifacts collected during your travels throughout the galaxies, cooking delicious and sometimes suspicious meals, gardening, fishing, sending your fleet on expeditions, managing settlements or just smuggling illegal goods and completing missions for pirates. You can enjoy exploring planets on foot, in an exocraft or on the back of your companion and when you find such a unique place, you can build a base there, which can become a home in this dangerous reality where you will sometimes have to fight enemies on the surface of the planet or in space at the controls of your starship, or just run away to avoid combat. One thing is certain in No Man's Sky, you are not alone... and you'll easily find allies to fight by your side, and maybe even make some new friends.", "hours": 97448, "hoursAtReview": 94761, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733264536}, {"text": "Amazing, breathtaking, immersive and fun game.\r\n\r\nGraphics are gorgeous. From the universe you are presented when you start the game, to the planets, the creatures, the ships, etc. everything looks wonderful. There are lots of places to stand and take amazing and breathtaking pictures.\r\n\r\nSound effects are great. The music and the ambience are really immersive, no matter what you are doing, you feel like you are in there. From exploring a spooky abandoned ship adrift in space, to exploring a planet full of life, to standing in the middle of a storm, the music and sound completely transports you to the game. Also, the sounds that the different alien races make are really well done and unique. It's always fun to listen to them talk and express different emotions.\r\n\r\nGameplay is amazing, there are LOTS and LOTS of things to do. For starters, you have a full universe to explore, you have 256 unique galaxies, that have approx. 4 billion regions, formed by 200 to 600 star systems and each one of those have from 2 to 6 planets. So you won't be finishing to explore it any time soon.\r\nLet's focus on what you can do on just one planet. You can explore the surface of the planet, document the plants, animals, rocks. You can explore caves, find rare resources, gather and mine a bunch of different materials. Furthermore, you can also go underwater, and explore deep oceans, and underwater caves. You can find buried treasures, crashed ships, lost ruins (both on the surface and underwater). You can also do missions for different alien factions. Not only that, but you can build your own base, on the sky, on the ground, underground and also underwater. You can build your own farm and grow exotic alien plants, and have alien animals to gather resources from. You can also build machinery to exploit big resource deposits and gases. Likewise, you can have your own alien settlement, build facilities and research things to make your citizens happy, and earn profit. Also defend them from hostile attacks. You can fight robots and hostile aliens. And a lot more things.\r\nAnd I'm not even started on what you can do outside the planet, which you can leave with your own ship, that you can buy, salvage or build from scratch using parts you collect from other ships. In fact, you can have a lot of ships if you want. And also have a squad of pilots which you can train and upgrade, to help you on space battles. You can explore the different planets and systems, find spooky abandoned capital ships adrift in space, mine asteroids for valuable resources, find rare alien life in space. You can also trade goods from system to system. Not only that, but you can become a bounty hunter and fight pirates or become one and raid trade ships and steal their valuable cargo. You can also be the commander of your own capital ship which you can customize and build a base on it, and with that you can have your own fleet of ships you can recruit, upgrade and send on missions to earn LOTS of units and materials. I won't spoil anymore because it's really great to discover on your own, a lot of the things you can do.\r\nAnother great thing in this game is the inventory system. In other survival games, you have so many tools for different things, in this one you have one tool, and you add attachments or technology to it which you can upgrade and find better versions. Also, the positioning on the inventory matters because each technology has upgrades that depending on where you put them, it increases the effectiveness of it. It's a really cool and interesting system. And the beauty of it, is that every vehicle and ship in the game works with this system, so everything has its own technology to find and upgrade.\r\nIt is true that after a while, some of the activities become repetitive, but with the amount of things you can do, you can choose to engage with different things. Also, it's true that after a while, you start to see some patterns that repeats on the different planets, it's a bit sad, but every once in a while you discover something that surprises you, even after you have seen a lot. So it's worthwhile to continue exploring. The devs continue to add new features and improvements over time, and for free, so there's always something new to experience. \r\nThere are many modes to play in this game, if you want to go full hardcore survival and difficult gameplay, or if you want to chill and don't have to grind at all, where you can build everything for free, you can fully customize every aspect of the difficulty to better match your gameplay style. Also, every once in a while, there are expeditions that offer a different play style, where everyone starts from scratch and follows a predetermined path completing missions, while earning rewards that you can then claim on all of your saves.\r\n\r\nThe story is great, but it's a bit all over the place. You can follow a certain storyline, but for the most part you have to look for lore pieces in different places, that if you are rushing or not paying much attention, you could easily miss. Overall, it's intriguing and leaves the door open for your own interpretation.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's an amazing huge game, with a lot to experience and get lost in it.

This quest for the perfect shot led to countless hilarious moments, especially when one of us found ourselves in an awkward encounter with one of the game's bizarre monsters.\n\nA personal highlight was our run-in with the Snailman.

The ASCII face designer adds an extra layer of personality, and it was always amusing to see the creative faces my friends came up with.\n\nCooperation is at the heart of the game. Navigating dark corridors, sharing resources, and rescuing each other from danger fosters a strong sense of camaraderie. The voice chat feature enhances this experience, as we constantly communicated, warned each other of impending threats, or simply laughed at our collective mishaps.\n\nFor newcomers, I recommend experimenting with the various gadgets and emotes.

This installment offers a compelling mix of deep gameplay mechanics, a unique visual style, and an approachable yet rewarding economic system.\r\n\r\n[h2] Unique Art Style [/h2]\r\nOne of the standout features of Three Kingdoms is its distinctive art style. The game uses a vibrant, painterly aesthetic that draws inspiration from traditional Chinese ink paintings. From the intricate details on character portraits to the sweeping landscapes of ancient China, every visual element contributes to an immersive experience that feels both authentic and beautiful.\r\n\r\n[h2] Diplomacy and Strategy [/h2]\r\nThe diplomacy mechanics in Three Kingdoms are among the best in the series. The game introduces a more nuanced relationship system, where alliances, rivalries, and personal bonds between characters play a significant role. This deep diplomatic layer allows for various strategies\u2014forming coalitions, betraying allies, or manipulating factions to weaken your enemies. It provides a refreshing alternative to the brute-force conquest typical in other strategy games.\r\n\r\nOn the battlefield, the tactical options are equally diverse. The ability to deploy ambushes, exploit terrain, and utilize specialized units makes each battle a thrilling chess match.\r\n\r\n[h2] Economy and Building System [/h2]\r\nThe economy and building systems in Three Kingdoms strike a balance between simplicity and depth. While not overly complex, the system is highly functional and rewarding. Players manage their empire\u2019s growth by constructing and upgrading buildings that enhance income, food production, or military recruitment. The straightforward design makes it easy for newcomers to pick up, while veterans can find room for optimization and strategic planning.\r\n\r\n[h2] A Perfect Game to Unwind [/h2]\r\nTotal War: Three Kingdoms excels in offering a gameplay loop that can keep players engaged for hours. Whether you\u2019re meticulously planning your next move on the campaign map or leading your troops to a hard-fought victory on the battlefield, the game provides a satisfying sense of progression.

However, if you're new to the game, there is little tips and explanation. When you level up your settlement, you take some bonuses. These bonuses cannot be reversed. So it you're experimenting with your first settlement, or need to take a town perk due to some urgent issue, like lacking food or fuel (i.e. not all down 1 single tree), then you've essentially bricked your settlement. You're locked out of the later parts of the tree because you will never get enough points to get some of those perks. \n\nOfc, once you know this, you'll probably want to start a completely new game such that you can specialize each of your settlements to avoid bricking your settlements.\n\nAdditionally, since the city-building part has the permanent houses only go up to level 3, it is actually pretty \"shallow\" once you hit that end. There are no lvl3 jobs for your serfs/citizens either.\n\nSome other minor, but frustrating bugs/issue for the city building include the workers building/upgrading a building randomly over-adding a required resource, somehow, and then just keep trying to add that resource without end, or being unable to collect supplies on the ground sometimes, meaning you cannot build on that plot of land until the weather weathers it away. A reload usually fixes these, but it's frustrating as you would have played a month or so of additional time before noticing. The snap-to-road feature is nice when placing buildings in an empty plot. But I should not be able to manually place non-housing buildings in tighter formation than the snapping tool.\n\nThe combat is interesting, but can be buggy with the path-finding at random times. \n\nThere is currently only 1 single map in early access, though the resources and fertility has some RNG to it, which makes for some repeatability.\n\n\nIf you want a more in-depth city builder that has the similar idea of \"demand\" for upgrading the town, try Farthest Frontier.

At first I thought maybe the brightly colored con-trails left by the ships indicated friend from foe, but nope, they just change colors for no reason at all - total waste of a mechanic. \n\nUnlocking new ships and weapons is INSANELY grindy, and the UI for the hangar bay is so tiny that the equipment descriptions is pretty much unreadable.

It's best enjoyed in short bursts rather than marathon sessions.", "hours": 176, "hoursAtReview": 176, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732455179}, {"text": "love the game but almost every time i open the game it says  missing file so i have to restart it and when i do it just says its still open the only way to fix it is to keep restarting my pc", "hours": 6930, "hoursAtReview": 5826, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731759387}, {"text": "I\u2019ve been playing Fall Guys since its launch in August 2020, and I\u2019ve seen the game evolve from having a lot of potential to becoming somewhat stagnant over time. Recently, I achieved 100% completion, which was both fun and agonizing, and it gave me a deeper understanding of the game, leading me to write this review.\r\n\r\nTo start, Fall Guys is a fun and entertaining game. I enjoy playing solo or with friends, although it\u2019s definitely more enjoyable with a group. That said, the game can get repetitive during longer sessions; it\u2019s best played in bursts of one to three hours.\r\n\r\nMost levels are fun, interesting, and sometimes challenging, while others can be rather boring. A recent addition I love is the ability to carry teammates (literally), which is both cute and helpful, especially since it lets me carry my girlfriend during matches. The developers have also introduced the functionality to create, host, and play custom games, which has been a highly requested feature. This addition is perfect for warming up or practicing specific levels if you\u2019re aiming to improve. Furthermore, the frequent rotation of game modes keeps things fresh by introducing new levels regularly.\r\n\r\nNow, for some broader points about the game, which aren\u2019t entirely related to the gameplay experience but are worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nIn March 2021, Fall Guys developer Mediatonic was acquired by Epic Games, and in my opinion, this was a turning point that led to a stagnation in its development.\r\n\r\nPreviously, you could earn cosmetics no matter their rarity just by playing the game. Winning a match rewarded you with Crowns, which could then be used to purchase cooler costumes. I personally got a lot of great skins this way. However, the current system no longer allows you to buy anything meaningful without spending real money. Microtransactions have been heavily injected into the game, making it far less rewarding to win a match. Now, the only incentive for winning is bragging rights (yay, I came first\u2026 \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f).\r\n\r\nThis shift is typical for any game acquired by Epic. They\u2019re doing the same thing to Rocket League, and it\u2019s disappointing to see. Sure, making the game free-to-play (F2P) brought in a massive player base, but for players who want to invest more time, there\u2019s little incentive to keep going.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Fall Guys is still a fun game, and I do recommend it. However, it does become repetitive and boring after a while, something the developers could work to avoid. Unfortunately, I doubt Epic Games will prioritize this, as their focus seems to be on monetizing the IP they\u2019ve invested in. It\u2019s not just about making money\u2014it feels like they want all the money.", "hours": 5281, "hoursAtReview": 5281, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732709467}, {"text": "I mean, you can't even buy it anymore, but if you have it you should play it.

I chose this entry because it leans more toward action than outright horror. While there are a few scary moments, it\u2019s mostly an action game with a dark setting and atmosphere rather than a truly terrifying experience.\n\nThe combat offers a unique experience, quite different from other games I have played. It\u2019s slower and more methodical\u2014there\u2019s no dodge move, so when enemies get close you have to either walk out of the way or rely on parrying with your knife, which costs durability. It forces you to manage limited resources, which is a great fit for the survival horror genre. However, while I think this combat style works well and fits the tone, I can\u2019t say I loved it. Personally, I prefer a more dynamic system where you feel nimble and less defenseless, rather than moving with the agility of a grandmother.\n\nThe moment-to-moment story is decent and easy to follow, though it didn\u2019t leave a lasting impression. On the other hand, the overarching lore was far more engaging, with neat backstories for the monsters and deeper mysteries about the world.\n\nOverall, Resident Evil 4 Remake is a great game, and I\u2019ve heard that fans of the original consider it a really good remake.

It's sluggish but flashy, relies too much on hoarding ammo and finding cover/camping spots to deal with the fast crowds, it's bloated with mind numbing sidequests and tryhard crafting mechanics, implements a half-baked parry system that makes the RE1 remake's emergency knives look like the most refined mechanic in the world of gaming, it handles the difficult scaling by removing agency from the player (making aiming pointless since it has even less staggering and only encourages to blast away the most powerful armament), it's generic over the shoulder shooting to the bone.\n\nCapcom took the baseline of Leon's movement, gave him the option to shoot while moving, duck, parry, etc, but changed the fundamentals of movement in order to nerf his snappy controls of the OG. While this is not bad on paper, the implementation is mid at best: he is slow, quarrels against super fast and aggressive enemies, and levels are made in such away that you have to AVOID certain bottlenecks or you are instantly dead. I can understand the hard fixed enemies when it's about zombies, but the infected ganados are supposed to be somehow sentient, so messing up with them to change their positions would make sense. However, the game expects you (the player) to solve encounters by either a) finding the magic camping spot to deal with the \"zombies\", or b) blast away with the most powerful gear.\n\nThere is one way to make this game actually enjoyable and dynamically challenging: mods. One particular approach I tried was a combination of the high mobility plus stagger mods so I could commit to crowd control while still playing *some* sequences under the cover/camping shoot'em all style. While it was fun, I got bored pretty fast... Since the level design is still drags and wastes the player's time.\n\nTo sum it up, this is like playing a high budget action Hollywood: entertaining but without any lasting impression, pretty much like most recent Capcom games. I'm sorry but I can't recommend this kind of stuff when there are better games that actually respect our time and bring something to the table. Too bad for the employees who worked really hard, because this is absolutely not their fault, since that would be the publisher's and stakeholder's greed.\n\nRemember when Lord Saddler and Leon had this extremely wacky and ironic conversations about American movies, corporate patriotism and the overall antics of the cultural industry? Well, this game is a prime example of THAT (fueled by Capcom's predatory business model, which I did not mention until now because some very devoted fans consider it to be off-topic).\n\nEdit: typos and spelling", "hours": 311, "hoursAtReview": 311, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732308771}, {"text": "This game is a gem, I probably beat the OG RE4 around 200 times over the years, I can see this one being about the same.

I'm not sure why game devs do this, but making enemies 10x more cancerous to fight does not make the game scary, it makes the game boring. PS enemies transforming after death is a stupid ass mechanic that shouldnt exist.\r\n\r\nOnce you rescue the girl the game becomes a cat and mouse chase where you spend a good amount of time going to a location only for the girl to get captured, and then you have to find her again, which fucks up the pacing tremendously, not to mention when you tell the girl to stay away and then she stands right behind you while 50+ enemies are charging at you, it becomes really annoying.\r\n\r\nAlso, why are you not able to buy ammo or herbs from the merchant? Why does the merchant sell different things every time? And why is most of what he sells completely useless?

The core gameplay mechanics such as the iconic melee kicks and now added parrying system make for such a fun shooting experience that balance each other out and keep the player engaged with the action. In addition, players are now able to crouch and 'stealth' their way through areas and backstab if they prefer a conservative combat style instead. Personally I would say that overall these new additions further enhance the immersion of the game and heavily improve on the old tank controls of the original game where you were basically defenseless if you were surrounded or close to an enemy. \r\n\r\nThe level design is also much improved and eerie given the jaw dropping visuals and lighting which once again add to the immersion when playing the game. As someone who enjoys casual gaming, I found it enjoyable to explore and backtrack in certain areas to collect pieces of treasure that are scattered across the map to sell for better weapon upgrades. \r\n\r\nIf you're a completionist, this game has a lot of replayability to unlock certain weapons and accessories that can provide extra bonuses, and additionally, the extra DLC content are just straight up fire. You can enjoy a fun combat focused gamemode in Mercenaries or play through Seperate Ways to experience the other half of the story which I can tell you is definitely worth investing as well.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you're a major fan of the previous titles of the Resident Evil series and feel hesitant with getting this one, trust me, I was too given the shift in direction that RE4 brought to the table.

The lore is insanely deep, and you can tell that this game has developers that really love Warhammer. Now for first time buyers, I'm going to tell you the one catch with this game. When the first game came out, they released DLC, and when the second game came out, you had the first game's DLC come with it if you bought it. They did the same thing when Warhammer III released. As someone who bought the first game and all of the DLC and then the next game with all of its respective DLC, I came into Warhammer III with 5-6 years worth of DLC. If you are a new player who hasn't played any of them, you are behind on around 8 years or ~$300 worth of DLC. Obviously that's a no go for a lot of people, especially in this economy. However, this game is on sale a lot, and all of that DLC can be bought for anywhere from 25-75% off depending which one it is which is huge. To anyone looking to get into this game, whether you are a fan of Warhammer or even someone looking to get into it, definitely get it, but get it when it's on sale and help yourself out. This game is easily a game you can sink thousands of hours into and not get bored, and if you can lower the cost for those thousands of hours, then definitely do it. I hope this review helped, and hopefully, you enjoy the game as much as I do.", "hours": 5637, "hoursAtReview": 5581, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732479677}, {"text": "Endless fun for me and my long time friend.

You can play the game without any dlc and still have a complete experience.\n\nThe base game offers around 10 factions/legendary lords. The structure is straightforward: you pick a race then pick your faction/legendary lord, start a campaign, and face off against all factions, including those from the dlc. Each campaign is lengthy, taking 20\u201330 hours or even more, depending on your goals and this what each dlc is gonna give you. So unless you\u2019re planning to play through all of the factions (its insane there are so many), there\u2019s no need to buy all the dlc. In fact, you should only purchase dlc as you play it.\n\nTL;DR:\nThe DLC\u2019s is like character in a fighting game\u2014you don\u2019t need to buy it unless you think its a cool character", "hours": 5421, "hoursAtReview": 4953, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732876587}, {"text": "7/10  This game possesses the best and worst (laziest/cheapest) aspects of any Total War game I've ever seen.  The battles are epic (some of the best I've ever played in a Total War title), but the siege battles have been completely trashed, especially if you're defending.  Utterly broken mechanics in sieges, weak-cookie-cutter towns (even the capitals), and for some reason, the cities are actually smaller than in War 1 and 2.  Sieges have been a mess ever since back in the day; a new ENGINE is required.  \n\nMost of the buildings aren't even clipped properly into the ground!  This is basic stuff.  And after \"three\" games and ten (10) years of development, it's absolutely unacceptable.  I've created better foundations in my settlements in Fallout 4.  I've seen better lava effects in the original DOOM (1993).  \n\nThe A.I. does work well in most situations, however.  \n\nThe \"cinematics,\" if you can call them that, are nothing more than a still image with over-the-counter animation software so it looks like things are moving when they really aren't.  Unfortunately, this has become a standard with lazy game developers these days.  If you compare the cinematics from old Blizzard (Starcraft 2, Diablo 3), and of course, Larian Studios' Baldur's Gate 3, you can instantly tell a difference.  \n\nThe price for this game is also astronomical.  We're talking $250.00+ for the \"full\" version.  Beyond Ridiculous.  Gamers are forced to pay for different factions and even characters within factions, and it's pathetic and just plain Greedy.  It'd be like charging per character in a fighting game.  And I'm not even going to touch on the hands-off approach to building up your settlements that has been completely reworked and dumbed-down, especially visually, since at least Rome 2.  \n\nMods are also hit or miss, and there's no real consensus about what works well and what doesn't.  \n\nWar 1, 2, and 3 are basically the same game.  1 is the Alpha, 2 is the Beta, and 3 is, unfortunately, the \"full\" version.  If you're not absolutely in love with the Chaos factions, you'll have a better time with War 1 and 2.

You have two campaigns, Realm of Chaos (Narrative-driven) and Immortal Empires (Sandbox campaign).

Commanding all those units and keeping track of everything can be overwhelming but take it slow and you'll get a feel for it. Learning what your units can do and making a good army composition helps immensely. You can choose the auto-resolve feature if you don't feel like fighting a specific battle (Don't get in the habit of doing this all the time, won't help you learn).\nLastly, the game is pretty intense on the computer.

[i]Civ 6[/i] is the game I always come back to. \n\nI play different kinds of games: [i]Guild Wars 2, Fallout 4, Stranded Alien Dawn, Skyrim, Railway Empire 2, Witcher, Medieval Dynasty.[/i]  If I like a game, I think nothing of sinking hundreds, sometimes thousands of hours into it.  But once I've wrung everything I can from a game, gotten all the achievements, played all the scenarios, I tend to walk away and never look back.\n\nBut [i]Civ 6[/i] is different. \n\nAfter I have exhausted a given game and as I search for the next big time suck, I boot up [i]Civ 6[/i] yet again, pick a civilization I haven't played yet and lose myself, yet again, in tech trees, city design, and yes, world conquest.  A campaign can take from four to ten days, depending on how much the rest of my life interferes.  It is a glorious time, immersed in nuance, strategy and the occasional gnashing of teeth.\n\nA reluctant shoutout is due here to the Mayhem mode that was introduced in the Brave New World expansion to [i]Civ 5[/i] and operates in the background of all [i]Civ 6[/i].  I am proceeding nicely in the early game with Tokugawa, a civilization that fully blossoms in the late game, when Menelik decides to attack me.  I had thought we were getting along, trading, respecting each other's borders.  Silly me.  Time for new strategy.  Thank you Mayhem.  The game does not let you get too comfortable.\n\nA feature of the game that is often overlooked but deserves a high five all its own is the history accompanying each civilization, district, and Great Person.  You can, of course, choose to skip each mini-lesson, but take it from somebody who reads EULAs and the sides of cereal boxes, there's a lot of fascinating stuff that somebody went to a lot of effort to include.\n\n[list][*]Finally, some cautions.  I have already alluded to the immersiveness and I am hardly the first to note that grocery shopping or lawn mowing can take a back seat while playing [i]Civ 6[/i].  On balance, that's a good thing.  It is what I celebrate in a great game.  But it is easy to forget to take a walk or reserve time for family and friends.  And, of course, the primary reason for such interludes is to encourage a mental reset, perhaps inspiring a shift in strategy or even just a question as to how something you might have ignored up to that point might help.  You can think of such interludes as playing the game, if you will, just at a lower intensity.\n\n[*]Also, if you are an achievement completionist, give up all hope ye who enter here.  There are an astonishing 320 possible achievements.  I have 41 of them after 500 hours on the PC.  I probably played about that much time on the PlayStation, before I switched to the PC and the comfy chair and big screen in the living room, but those PS achievements are gone forever.  Still, completing all the achievements in this game is for the truly obsessed.  Consider therapy.\n\n[*]Inexplicably, [i]Civ 6[/i] does not take advantage of Steam cloud saves.  Don't be like me and open up your laptop in a hotel one night only to discover that all your saved games are playable solely from my home computer.\n\n[*]Finally, the negative reviews tend to fall into two camps.  Either the game is unplayable because of glitches or [i]Civ 5[/i] was better.  I can't remember any crashes on the PC, but in any event set your Autosaves to ten and you will be covered.  As for the [i]Civ 5[/i] devotees, I'm happy for you that you found a game you love.  But it's also true that change can be hard, for some people more than others.  [i]Civ 6[/i] is a wonderful game regardless of how wonderful [i]Civ 5[/i] was.[/list]\n\nIf you have any interest in strategy 4x games, it is hard to imagine that you have not discovered [i]Civ 6[/i] yet, but by all means I encourage you to do so.  And even if you have discovered it, but have been away for awhile, [i]Civ 6[/i] is exceptional in welcoming you back (and you can discover anew that a fighter jet cannot take out a missile cruiser).

From its gripping co-op gameplay to its relentless action, this game has set the bar for what a zombie apocalypse game should be, and it's one that I've continuously returned to since its release. Here's why I believe it\u2019s the best zombie game I've ever played.\r\n\r\nFirst off, the cooperative gameplay in Left 4 Dead 2 is second to none. It\u2019s not just about surviving a wave of zombies; it\u2019s about surviving together. The game places you and up to three friends in the shoes of one of four unique survivors, each with their own personality and witty lines, which makes each character feel real and integral to the experience. The level of teamwork required to survive through hordes of undead makes the gameplay dynamic and constantly thrilling. Whether it's coordinating a rescue when someone is pinned down or saving your friend from a surprise smoker attack, no two runs are ever the same.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this game stand out in the zombie genre is its AI Director. This ingenious system randomly generates enemies, resources, and even the map layout, ensuring that no two playthroughs are ever alike. The AI Director keeps players on their toes, constantly adjusting the difficulty to match your team's performance, making it feel like the game is alive and reactive. One minute, you're feeling like you're in the clear, and the next, the Director throws a horde at you, forcing you to scramble for cover. This unpredictability keeps each session fresh and exciting, even years after its release.\r\n\r\nThe variety of zombie types in Left 4 Dead 2 is another standout feature. The standard zombies, or \"infected,\" are horrifying enough, but it\u2019s the special infected that truly add to the game's intensity. From the terrifying Tank that can obliterate you with one punch to the Spitter\u2019s acidic bile that forces you to move or die, each special infected changes the way you approach a fight. The atmosphere is always tense, knowing that at any moment, one of these deadly enemies could appear, altering the course of the game.\r\n\r\nThe map design is also exceptional. From the claustrophobic interiors of a run-down mall to the expansive fields of a rural town, each map is filled with environmental storytelling and places to explore. The level of detail in the world-building is fantastic, and the game\u2019s visual style is timeless. The sound design is equally impressive, with the distant growls of zombies, the eerie ambience, and the shrill scream of a Witch all adding to the sense of dread and urgency.\r\n\r\nFinally, the multiplayer experience in Left 4 Dead 2 is unparalleled. Whether you're playing with friends or joining a random team online, the game fosters a sense of camaraderie and mutual survival. It\u2019s a game that thrives on teamwork and communication, with players needing to look out for each other and make split-second decisions to survive. The adrenaline rush of fighting off a massive zombie horde or attempting to complete an objective while under constant threat is a rush that few other games can match.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is, without a doubt, the best zombie game I\u2019ve ever played. Its combination of cooperative gameplay, randomization, thrilling action, and iconic zombies makes it a masterpiece in the genre. Years after its release, it continues to deliver the same level of excitement and tension that made it an instant classic. If you\u2019re a fan of zombie games, this is a must-play, and it\u2019s the one that set the standard for all others that followed.", "hours": 1733, "hoursAtReview": 1733, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734130385}, {"text": "This game costs a dollar when it's on sale.

The game in various aspects like AI and Gunfire still holds up pretty well. The levels are well-designed and so are enemies. However, my biggest grievance will be AR in terms of weapon as it was just bad, exteremly inaccurate and low damage output. Making it almost useless after you get shotgun or you'll just end up getting handgun for yourself. There are mainly four types of enemies only (excl. Floods). As mentioned, game still holds up pretty well even after 23 years of its release. However, after a point game starts to show its age. Biggest noticeable is in fourth level where you'll find tonnes of repetitive assets across the level and its not in a good way. and also Shotgun's reload can't be interrupted with LMB unless you manually switch weapon which can overwhelm you easily when against floods as thats when you find this gun. Adding more while soundtrack is greatly amazing, it feels repetitive at some point and extremely weird at some points. Like at the end of the game in Warthog section (another thing I'll talk about later), the music which is playing is the one that plays during open area of level 2. Its so weird to have everything exploding and music is just kinda chill. And the elephant in the room, Warthog, oh boy, this shit is atrocious to control. If Mako from ME1 and this shit were to have a competition on which feels worse to drive, they'd be fighting on for days. One of my favourite section for Warthog is when Keyes says, \"Its warthoggin time and hogged everywhere\". Imagine being so bad to drive that devs have literally added an achievement to celeberate that you didnt fumble your ride. On other side, I loved how well explanation of lore was given by terminals you'd find in every level. I loved that thing and how well cutscenes were made in those terminals. Most of my grievances came from the persepective of modern gaming, otherwise it's an easy 9/10. Fairly-crafted world, fights were pretty good.\n\nNow for Halo 2, while the fighting mechanic stays the same, the improvised and imcreased the amount of weaponary one could possess. They made an improved version of AR even though it does only 3 shots at one click. Not only for humans, they included many alien weapons too like Energy claws, Plasma Rifle, carbiner, Grenade launcher and what not. Increased the range of vehicles. They added a small QoL change in Shotgun that now reload can be interrupted by Left-clicking which makes fighting against floods way easier. Magnum was nerfed which was a bummer but I also noticed how the game lacked melee animations from last game as well which is a shame. Introduction of new enemies improved the game as well. Having to play another character alongside Chief to run a paralel story is always a welcome adition. My grievances with Warthog are also minimised as now it feels actually good to control as it is not that floaty anymore. However ally AI is dumb as brick, I'll give it to that. I suggest you play the original version first and then the anniversary because anniversary cutscenes blow the original one out of water.\n\nHalo 3. It continues after the cliffhanger from Halo 2. The game features new UI and weaponry. Variety of grenades are added but however total grenade count which can be carried is still 8. Thats a bit of a downgrade. The grenades are frag grenades, plasma (sticky) grenade, 1940 WW2 grenades and Incendiary grenades. Unlike Halo 2, this campaign is mainly Master Chief, however, the campaign felt a bit shorter this time as compared to Halo 2 but then Halo 2's missions are difficult in general so it could be that. Alien weapons got some new stuff like Spiker and also that Plasma Sword depletes fairly slower than Halo 2 (if playing as Master Chief in H2). My beloved AR returned and that too in a better form and felt great while using it and it became my mainly prefered weapon in Flood-based levels. Enemy AI has gotten better but i cant say that for my lovely Warthog. Warthog downgraded. Felt more slippier than Halo 2 and also has another Warthog section to add to this delight. I'd rather choke on nails than to play another Warthog level again. Suspense leading to Cortana throughout the whole game was good but it felt like it was half-arsed if anything. Like they wanted to do something with it but then changed their mind. This game also solidifies change in dynamics between Cortana and chief as in how she acted differently when met and how it was at the end. Another suspense left at the end, but I think it closed an arc properly and no one would've minded if the next Halo was about finding Master Chief. I can't really talk about Arbiter stuff as it is locked to Co-op only but I'd check it later. I think it's a fairly good game and I had a fun with it. Some buffs were good and also return of Ar with improved reliability was great. But also I didnt like the change in Terminals, they were great as a cutscene. I dont mind reading stuff but cutscenes and its visuals were miles ahead than that of Halo 3's Terminals which is just plain text. I'll also give opinion on these as I have to revisit the game for Terminals too.\n\nThe next one in this list is Halo: ODST. In my opinion, its the most unique Halo experience as it is the game from human's perspective. The game takes place during the events of Halo 2 (presumably around the end of it as there was lack of elites). In this game, the main focus is on an unnamed mute character called Rookie, making it one of the two games where main character isn't master Chief (other one being Halo Reach). They are part of a squad called ODST and called upon to assist on stopping the covenant attack in Mambasa. The game mainly shows us human side of the conflict. Combat is prctically the same, its still different. Our character is extremely fragile. For the first and probably only time, you'd hear screams, constant wailing in pain and trying to take deep breathes when you get hurt. Your health is froze at a point until you go and pick health packs. You don't have strong  shield so youre only safe for initial shots. In the game, you control all the member of platoon gradually. As rookie until the last two missions, your purpose is to find the clues leading to what happened to your teammates. And its interesti8ng how well they managed to show fragility of humans. Brute Chief, someone who gets manhandled by Spartans or John-117 was killing everyone and punctured lung of fellow marine, and it took four people to take that thing down and that too while it was distracted. While the sequential levels play normal, Rookie sections play vastly different. It's dark and you're alone and to accompany that, there is music dominated by Piano and sometimes saxophones. Also this game was first one to introduce silenced weapons. Game also deincentivises you to initiate combat as Rookie as it would be certain death and you can avoid contact as him. Apart from that, gameplay is mainly as same as Halo 3. Despite being the easiest campaign so far as I died the least here, it was defibnitely a unique experience honestly.\n\nHalo Reach is last Halo game from Bungie. We dont control master Chief in this one. We control Noble six who's completely customisable in the game. We are members of team Noble. We learn about the events of the Planet Reach and how it set everything up for Halo: CE. We learn about the other five members in our team and the tragic end to the Reach. This is also the only Halo so far where aliens dont speak english to make you feel more like that they are an alien. The combat is practically the same except for small tweaks and additions like DMR. However game starts off very light and takes a tragic turns after the halfway point. And I found that every character in your team died an ironic death. Demolition expert died in an explosion, tech guy died due to tech malfunction, lone wolf died as a team player, close counter expert died due to backstab...

I'll start off with a short best/worst section for each campaign and then move on to an in-depth explanation. Mind you, a lot of people probably won't agree with me, and this comes from someone completely new to this franchise.* \nFYI: I've played it all on normal difficulty and with no multiplayer involved.

I absolutely loved them all. I don't find that they get development throughout the game, but they're memorable in my opinion! The story is also good. It wasn't the best, which might be caused by my confusion of it being my first Halo game. The visuals are good for a game from 2010, and the audio is really good! Now onto the bad. I experienced a few soft locks throughout the game which were annoying. For example for the last long mission being mission 10, I encountered a soft lock right at the end which made it impossible for me to progress without dying over and over. I was forced to either restart the mission from the beginning or manually choose where I start. Which had me go through a kinda tedious part with like three waves. It's a minor thing, but I can't find much else to say that was \"the worst\" for Reach. Loved it, love the characters. Kat is a baddie, Jun is my best buddy cause he gave me a sniper-rifle. And that's Halo Reach for ya! \n\n[h3]Halo Combat Evolved[/h3]\nThis campaign felt much easier to find the best and worst for! Story absolutely carried the game. Combat was fun, but challenging at times with a variety of enemies to mix it up. However, I'm not a big gamer and found it to be a bit tiring at times, and what made me continue was the craving I had to get to the end. Moving on to the worst part, which is without a doubt the mission designs. GOD THE REPETITION IS BAD! There is so much time spent walking through rooms that are super similar to each other. Enter a room, fight a few enemies, go to the other side of the room, go through a corridor, repeat. It's poor design and a lot of reused stuff. And no I won't shit more on it, cause of course it is! This game was a breakthrough when it released, and so I won't spend anymore time bashing on a game from 2001. I imagine older gamers of this franchise play this game mostly for the nostalgia or to refresh on the story.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is totally worth the money.

This is a big map and you'll come across the same 4 bandits (5 if you count the dogs, 6 if you count the bosses) everywhere.\n-Combat is essentially spam left click and dodge sometimes. No abilities, no cooldowns, no skill involved whatsoever.\n-The item progression feels terrible. You don't craft weapons, you find them. You do craft different armors, but they never felt like a true upgrade over the random pieces you find.\n-The building system is probably great if you're a creative person, but for me, it felt extremely unintuitive and clunky.\n-Optimization is terrible. The game itself runs ok, but when I open the map and zoom out, I can literally hear my GPU shit itself and my fps drops to 3 (you read that right, three).

It gets way too dark at night, things need to be a little more visible rather than being pitch black, or at the very least they should provide a night vision potion or night vision ability in the skill tree.\r\n\r\n2.) The questing system needs to improve, in multiplayer especially sometimes quests get completed but it's not shared so I miss out on the XP and I have to do the mission solo. Also some quests need a checklist or a little more guidance in the description. I understand they want people to explore and find things on their own as they play but sometimes its a little too vague and confusing. They don't need to completely hold my hand, some puzzle solving and encouraging exploration is nice but there are a couple missions that seem to require a guide. For example, I never would have found all the fossils or the Blackmire crafting recipes if I didn't look it up.\r\n\r\n3.) The map needs improvement, an elevation indicator for quest locations, flame shrines and other markers on the map and more detail would definitely help.\r\n\r\n4.) Placing and moving furniture can be frustrating, trying to maneuver the camera in order to see the \"E\" indicator so you can pick up an item is frustrating especially if it's in an awkward position or if you end up picking up the wrong item. Furniture placement should be more like it is with placing building blocks.\r\n\r\n5.) There needs to be a size indicator while crafting items so you can tell how big an item is before you craft it. Sometimes items look like they will be small but they end up a lot larger than expected.\r\n\r\n6.) Flame shrines and sanctums should have a checkmark when you discover them so you can tell which ones you've been to and which ones you still need to find in order to make the associated achievements more fun to get.\r\n\r\n7.) I do experience the occasional crash and graphical glitch, also it can lag for me. It might be due to an outdated graphics card so keep that in mind.\r\n\r\nHere are things I like about the game:\r\n\r\n1.) Building bases is awesome, the controls take a little getting used to but it's relatively easy to make something really cool and they provide a lot of variety for aesthetics. It feels pretty free. If you decide you don't like a way a wall looks it's easy to replace it with a different block. Having an undo button is really convenient as well. The base building is one of the best aspects of the game.\r\n\r\n2.) Combat is fun, lots of skills and abilities to choose from and a good sense of progression throughout the course of playing the game. I wish there was more variety of enemies, maybe more unique enemies for each biome.\r\n\r\n3.) Dying isn't as punishing as it is in other games, also they did a great job in making it possible to recover your items in most places you die.\r\n\r\n4.) I like the number of different weapons and armor options in the game and the ability to enhance weapons. Some armor sets look pretty cool, and it's fun to collect items and it's easy to recycle weapons if you don't want them anymore. I wish I could recycle and upgrade armor, rings, and shields as well but maybe they'll add that later.\r\n\r\n5.) There's a lot of variety in furnishings and decorations. I wish the bard had more banner options or if you had the ability to dye items for different aesthetics.\r\n\r\n6.) I was really pleased with the mountain biome that came out recently, although it can be tough to navigate sometimes I think it was really well done for the most part. Also the added features like pets and farm animals as well as additional NPCs was really nice. I kind of wish you could control exactly where the NPCs go when they wander around rather than just a radius, like setting a path or restricting them to a room because they can be a little hard to find at times when they wander off.\r\n\r\n7.) The game is really fun to play multi-player, aside from some issues with quests and the occasional lag I've been having a lot of fun playing with friends.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I know it sounds like I've been making a lot of complaints but overall I have enjoyed playing the game. All of the issues I have mentioned can be addressed in future updates so I look forward to the next one and looking at the roadmap it seems they are heading in the right direction.

If you just want to build a nice village or castle or whatever, go for it. Most of the bad mechanics are excusable for that purpose. If you are looking for an actual survival-rpg with good combat, this isn't it. \r\n\r\nI got Enshrouded when it first launched into Early Access. On paper, it's like a wet dream. And I did play it quite a bit, most of the time spent doing what the game does best: building. But it's not only a base building game now, is it?\r\n\r\nAt first glance the game looked very promising to me. There was a lot of content right at the start, and if they were to improve the actual gameplay mechanics of the game, it would be candidate for an all time favorite. So I gave it time. \r\n\r\nNow, it's 10 months and several major updates later, most of which seem to be \"more content\" in the form of reskinned enemies, more empty landscape and half baked additional mechanics. At this point I'm quite certain that the glaring issues will not be handled at all, and there will be just \"moaaar\". \r\n\r\nLet's look at what the game claims to be: A survival sandbox action-rpg experience. \r\n\r\nSandbox:\r\nThis, they have down. You can spend hours on building (and grinding for materials to build, which can be a bit much at times), as I did. The building system worked great and the only thing limiting you, is your imagination and right angles. \r\n\r\nSurvival: Well, you can eat, and I see they have added an option to die after a certain amount of minutes after being hungry. They added a body heat system with the latest patch that only applies in the new region. No other \"survival\" elements, besides crafting. The survival mechanics being superficial do not hurt the game though, since another thing to have to grind for would hurt the game much more. I would just have omitted the term \"survival\" from the description. \r\n\r\nAction-RPG: This is where the game sadly fails miserably. The combat is clunky and flat. The only type of \"class\" that has somewhat evolving gameplay is the mage class. \r\n\r\nCombat: As said before, the combat is clunky. Combat animations seem inconsistent, merciless attack is straight up useless, since the animation goes on for too long, without an iframe. Targeting is inconsistent, too much forward momentum in attacks can easily send you off cliffs. In late game/hollow halls the game just throws hordes of enemies at you to increase difficulty, which makes parrying almost obsolete (except with shockwave talent, and even then) and range nuking by far the best option. \r\nNumbers often dont seem to be tuned at all (even though they can be somewhat tuned in the world settings).\r\nThe base stamina regeneration is way too low. You spend a lot of time just walking around in combat dodging very telegraphed attacks by just sidestrafing, waiting for your stamina to come back up. This is especially true in early levels, in the later game it is compensated by chucking sugar like a fat kid in a candy factory. you could think this game is promoting diabetes. Kidding aside, I do get that they want to keep buff food relevant, and it's literally just one number to fix. Even with sugar, it can be a slog. The Buff food issue could have been solved differently, for example by having it primarily increase max stamina, give faster regen if you completely empty your stamina or halve the stamina on an empty belly. those are just off the top of my head. \r\nMelee combat is lackluster at best. Even only having a heavy attack would mitigate some of it, but as it stands now, it's just spamming left click and dodging/blocking once in a while. \r\nRanged combat is spamming explosive arrows in late game.\r\nI won't even cover enemy tracking, some of the enemy ranged attacks or scavenger matron poison. \r\n\r\nLevel-Curve/Progression: too many low level areas, no level scaling to keep low level areas somewhat interesting. High level enemies drop pretty much the same as low level enemies, outside of gear. \r\n\r\nMovement/Input Queue: This is also very inconsistent. Sometimes it seems actions I input get queued, sometimes not. This can mean life or death in the game. Sometimes, I can double jump, sometimes, the second jump immediately opens the glider. Minor bumps in the landscape can send you yeeting off to the distance or down where you came from should you tread falsely. In general the sliding mechanic is more annoying than fun. You can compensate some of it by moving slowly/without sprinting/jumping much, but considering the size of the map...\r\n\r\nTalent Tree (Circle): It's actually fascinating how they managed to make the talent tree both superficial AND overly complicated at the same time. All talents in the center of the Circle should be baseline abilities. Having to put (a lot of!) points into a stamina break finisher or sneak attack seems off. \r\nProgression through the circle is often nonsensical, most of the nodes are just straight up stat increases or other passive bonuses with some forced alteration. Double jump is basically mandatory and should be a baseline ability as well, so should updraft. Finding another weapon often means respecing, and specializing in a certain element or damage type is also a moot point, since it mostly depends on the weapon you currently have as your main weapon. \r\n\r\n\"Role-Playing\": Where RPG? you do have some RPG mechanics, like stat points and gear, but you don't really interact with the world or the people in it, once you have summoned them into your base. Of course they do give you quests, but you dont have choices, talking points or anything else that would qualify the game as a role playing game. You don't matter and \"story wise\" it seems you have only one way to go forward. \r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Points:\r\n\r\nMap Design: someone should tell developers that \"big maps\" don't equal \"better maps\". For the most part, the world of enshrouded feels empty (yeah, it's kind of a story point I know), with some rare PO(not so)I's scattered through a big, big world, where you will spend a lot of time digging your way up cliffs. It's nice that I CAN do it, but it's annoying how often I HAVE TO. There are some hazards scattered throughout the world in form of lava rivers or some green stuff that drains your stamina, but by far the worst is the almost instakill red shroud stuff, with often no way to get out quickly. respawn points are rare and distances far, which makes dying to something like this especially frustrating. \r\n\r\nBugs: Essential Talents for Group Play (f.e. Nemesis/Arch Nemesis) have been broken for months. There have been content updates in the meantime, but broken essentials dont get fixed? Priorities, people, priorities. \r\nRespawning Dead with no way to respawn again. \r\nShared Progression not working. \r\n\r\nPhysics: increase the weight, things might stop yeeting like crazy. \r\n\r\nItem Progression: Inconsistent. Get weapons from enemies, but craft armor for the most part. being able to craft weapons would make specializing in certain elements or damage types more useful. \r\n\r\nCrafting: often overly complicated. Run to the Smith to get nails and then go to the carpenter to make a chest, and that's a short example. A central \"crafting order board\" or something alike could mitigate that, making you able to centrally manage production as \"leader\" of your village. Having your production split over 7 craftspeople as well as multiple machines has you weigh between building an organic village/base or just stuffing everything in one big room for convenience. The first choice will have you walking a lot. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of these issues have been there since launch, and I do not see any efforts to fix or improve them. \r\n", "hours": 11317, "hoursAtReview": 11317, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732021396}, {"text": "Once you get beyond the start the difficulty goes sidewise.

There is a lot of things to say about this game, the game has a lot of good points, but also some questionable aspects. \n\n[h1]The good[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] The game looks great! The environment design is very well done and the graphics are stunning!\n[*] The base-building system is very competent, in particular, the base relocation system is awesome and something I haven't seen any other game do nearly as well\n[*] The bosses are very varied mechanically and are all pretty interesting to fight (although I'm not a big fan of the fact that many of them spawn minions)\n[*] The game offers visually distinct storage furniture for each category of items, I wish more games did this!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]The slightly questionable things[/h1]\n\n[h2]The combat[/h2]\nThe game's combat system takes some getting used to. Your dodge option has a very long cooldown (8 seconds), while bosses attack much faster than that. The bosses are designed so that most attacks can be dodged with regular movement once you know how the bosses's moveset work, but it still makes your first fight with each boss a not very fun experience.\n\nFurthermore, the game has a weird approach to healing - as in, healing is not really a thing. For the first half of the game, your only real healing option is \"blood-mend\", except it locks you in a T-pose stance while you heal, which is sub-optimal in the middle of combat. \nStarting the second half of the game, you do unlock enough skills and items to be able to make a build that can self-heal, however that remains limited, and there is in fact a hard cap on how much you may heal, and the workings of this cap are so unclear that I have still not figured out how it works after 150 hours.\n- To give you an idea, essentially, if you get take a full combo to the face, most of the HP you lost is unrecoverable and you just have to not get hit again. \nI can't say I very much liked that, it made some bosses feel like a DPS race..   \n\n[h2]The PvE[/h2]\n\nI played on a PvE server with friends, we didn't want the pressure of PvP, and certainly didn't want the pressure of having to protect our bases from other players.\nAfter playing for a while, it became pretty clear that the game is very much designed for PvP and that PvE was an afterthought. Some of the boss/main quest rewards have no use in PvE... \nThe game also does not let you teleport if you have \"valuable\" (which is a lot of items) items in your inventory, presumably so that other players can attack you and take it from you when you're on your way home, but in PvE that just feels like an annoying, arbitrary restriction. \n\nAnother thing that is leans heavily towards PvP and has little purpose in PvE is the \"Soul Shards\", those are end-game equipment that drop from the last 4 bosses of the game, geared specifically for PvP (+15% damage to vampires, so other players). These can only be stored in their own specific (huge!) storage furniture, which appears on the map of other players (for base raiding purposes,  so completely irrelevant in PvE) and they lose durability simply by existing. After having lost all their durability (within a day or two), you can only repair them by killing the bosses of incursions, a world map invasion event (which itself isn't very fun because very repetitive). \nObtaining those soul shards on a PvE server left us wondering \"what the hell do we do with those...?\" \n\n[h2]The grind curve[/h2]\n\nThe grind curve gets pretty rough, it took me ~150 hours to \"complete\" (kill the final boss). You progress at a good pace until mid-game where the curve starts becoming a straight vertical line. It was rough enough that for a few weeks I was mostly just letting my servants do passive farming for me until I had enough resources to craft the equipment I needed to progress. \nSo you know what you're getting into, according to the Steam achievements, only 5.2% of players have beaten the final boss, which may suggest that a lot of players have dropped the game before finishing it (maybe also because of the final boss being a huge difficulty spike)\n\n[h2]Yeah the final boss is something alright[/h2]\n\nI'm not actually sure how I feel about it, but yeah as I stated before, the final boss is a massive difficulty spike - intentionally so, the boss was given multiple different opening voice lines amongst other things because the developers very much expect you to get shit on the handful first few times you fight him. \nI don't know what horror this boss must be on \"brutal\" difficulty and frankly I don't want to find out :), but I do have a lot of respect for the 1.2% of players who did beat it on brutal \n\n[h1]Where cosmetics :([/h1]\nThis is a very minor thing all things considered, but I am a bit disappointed in the lack of cosmetic outfits. There is a cosmetic system which sees practically no use in the base game, it does see a bit more use with DLCs but still not so much, which feels like a bit of shame considering that the framework is there.\n\n[h1]The very questionable[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*] The game does NOT let you pick a specific amount out of a stack of items. The game only lets you split a stack of items in half, which is incredibly frustrating.\n[*] Compounding with the above missing basic QoL feature, crafting tables are not able to take materials from nearby storage, forcing you to move around your castle a lot when crafting. This is pretty baffling as the game asks you to make specific rooms for each \"type\" of crafting (so you'll have a forge room, an alchemy room...) so it would be intuitive for the crafting tables to be able to take materials from storage that is in the same room. \n[*] Because of the above, crafting and storing resources felt like a genuine chore and takes much longer than it should :(\n[*] I talked about how the game has distinct storage for each category of items earlier and how that was great - but it's not perfect. Some items are categorized very awkwardly; For instance, Power Cores are categorized as an \"alchemy\" item, so you put it in either alchemy storage of generic storage, but power cores do not have a single recipe in alchemy, they're only used in forging and jewelry, so they're very unintuitive to store..\n[*] The building system is overall very competent - except for stairs. The game does not let you replace staircases even if it's the same type of staircase with only a different skin, and that is despite having a feature that lets you easily change the color of furniture with multiple color options. The game does not let you remove stairs either if they're the only stairs connecting to the upper floor, so if you want to be able to change your stairs when you unlock new stairs, you NEED to build two sets of stairs for all your castle floors..\n[*] Trading with humans is practically worthless, despite it being a hassle to do in the first place. Human traders rarely have the items you're looking for, particularly when it comes to seeds, seeds are incomprehensibly hard to get...\n[*] Some of the animal forms have very little use. Rat form is useful for sneaking around, wolf form helps you get around faster, bear form lets you mine big deposits of minerals, bat form lets you fly, and... spider form lets you... dig into the ground (???) to \"hide from enemies and the sun\", except you can't move at all and enemies can still hit you anyway?? and toad form lets you jump higher but there is seemingly no benefit from being able to do so?\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nThe fact that the \"good\" section is a lot smaller than the rest of the review may be misleading, I'm nitpicking a lot, the game is overall very good, although I really don't get why would anyone play PvP? I also don't see this game being nearly as fun without friends.\nAs for the replayability, ehhhh...

You will not get any difficult puzzles here. It's really about the protagonists \"story\" that they want to display here and make you catch a glimpse of what it might feel like to be the protagonist. Most of the time you get the solutions thrown at your face, but there is one part in the game where i felt a bit confused. That's also where my controls went a bit funky. Not sure why. SPOILER_START[spoiler]Now i don't fully know what the game is called in english but it looks like chess, however it is only using flat circles as the stones. So maybe it's called \"checkers\" or so. Anyway, when there is that checkers board in the center of the room you will have to collect pieces of the boardgame which took me a bit to understand. And once you finished it you had to walk back to the table on which the boardgame was to progress. That's where i had the problems with a rotating camera and the sound not being played on both ears in stereo-fashion.[/spoiler]SPOILER_END\n\nOne improvement i suggest is making the player more aware of where to look. They used the enforced-camera-look but when some vital things were happening i scurried too fast through the door or looked somewhere else and completely missed the action.\n\nNow one thing i really didn't like is the sound design. It's not the sound itself but for some reason when i played this with my headset i could either hear directional sounds on the left or the right ear. Meaning, if i was in front of a door, or a drawer i would have to look a bit offset at it to get the sound played. And if i looked straight onto anything that has directional sound i would not get the sound at all. For example a piano, when it played an i looked straight at it, i couldn't hear it. If i turned the camera a bit to the left or right i was able to hear it but just on one ear. I suppose that's on unity. Or maybe my headset. Who knows. \n\nAnd another bug was that my camera just started rotating for no reason and i was unable to stop it. Maybe that was also on my side, but that can happen i guess.\n\nApart from that i would say a solid game. But in my honest opinion i wouldn't have bought it for 20\u20ac. Maybe 10\u20ac.

Nevertheless, a few peculiar events did follow. I was working late in my study one night when a figure crept up from the dungeons. Who could this be? I peered around the corner, and was alarmed to discover my willowy, nine-year-old daughter stepping out of the dungeons, wiping her hands on her dress.\r\n\r\nI rose and confronted her at once. My daughter made no attempt to hide the strange, blood-like stains on her hands, and she smiled wanly at my questions. She had a peculiar look in her eyes, and I noticed that she had a small, cruel-looking knife at her side, also color of blood. She was a quiet child, and answered me nothing. Exasperated by her intransigence, I sent her straight to bed.\r\n\r\nI thought nothing more of it. My wife had been a wildcat with bizarre and occult interest; I assumed some of this weirdness had rubbed off on her child. \r\n\r\nA few months later, tragedy struck. My other daughter, the elder, pitched headlong off of the castle wall and broke her neck. I was sick with grief; she had looked so like her mother, and had been developing so nicely. I could hardly focus on matters of state. Some in my court suspected foul play - my spymaster seemed like he had a theory, but wouldn't yet put it to me. I, for one, was convinced it was a judgement of God on my sins. After all, my older daughter had been walking alone except for the younger.\r\n\r\nPerhaps another year passed. My new queen has swollen with child, and we pray day and night that it shall be a boy to succeed me. Then I hear horrible news: my spymaster was killed in a brawl in the lower town! Appalled, I ordered an investigation. The murderer was never found, but I learned that he had allowed himself to be drawn into a knife-fight with a group of feral urchins. Apparently, a waif of a whore girl had expertly cut his throat. It will take some time to accomadate my new spymaster to the secret workings of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nI was encouraged by the birth of my son, but it was difficult to escape the sense of a pall about me. God's judgement laid heavily upon me, and my woes did not cease. No sooner was the child born than it died. My court physician said the child had asphyxiated, but I do not know how this could have been the case. No one was allowed to see the child except my immediate family - myself, my wife, and my darling daughter from my previous marriage. \r\n\r\nI suppose you can see what I did not. My sins against God were great, I know this. Even now I turn in the hell that was prepared for me. But no greater error did I commit than to kill my first wife, who was an adept in the forbidden mysteries of darkness. I shudder to recall the horrific tomes she kept, which I burned. But I did not destroy all of her works. The spawn of the devil came for me only two short years later. She had learned poisons, God knew how, or from whom, at her age. She watched my writhe in agony, her cold eyes drinking in my pain, soulless eyes no girl could possess. Then she ended my suffering, and threw me down to the hell she had arisen from. \r\n\r\nIn a few short years, my daughter ascended to the throne of my hard-won kingdom, every potential rival from my extended family dead. And then her reign of terror began. \r\n\r\nBut that's another story...", "hours": 43834, "hoursAtReview": 43834, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731717218}, {"text": "Great game, tonnes of replayability.", "hours": 122258, "hoursAtReview": 120773, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733422910}, {"text": "nice game strongly recommend", "hours": 18685, "hoursAtReview": 17607, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732711118}, {"text": "Conquer, very good", "hours": 53061, "hoursAtReview": 53059, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733369759}, {"text": "i have yet to learn how this game works 100/10", "hours": 259301, "hoursAtReview": 259301, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731823357}, {"text": "good", "hours": 32201, "hoursAtReview": 30961, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732540376}], "name": "Crusader Kings II"}, "334210": {"reviews": [{"text": "Crashes sooooooo much, within 4 hours it crashed 8 times between 4 people.

It is arguably quite sad that Giants releases a decent base game, and the first thing that people are looking for is what cool mods are available for it.  If it were my game, I would be quite embarrassed by that, but Giants seems to embrace it.\n\nAnyone who has submitted a mod to Giants to have featured on their modhub or made available for consoles, knows the hurdles you have to jump over, and the hoops you have to jump through.  If your store image isn't to just the right specifications, they will deny your mod.  If you have an inverted polygon on the inside of the model that no one will ever see, they will deny your mod.  If your tie rod node is off by just a quarter of a fraction, they will deny your mod.\nSo why, with a company who is so diligent with mods, are there so many issues with the base game?\n\nWe are seeing reports of issues cutting trees, stacking bales, vehicles with unrealistic or abnormal mass, and semi trucks with physics comparable to FS15 when trucks would fly across the map at 1243532mph just from exiting the vehicle in a field.\n\nAre the big name modders and YouTube streamers so far up Giants' ass that they didn't report any of these issues while they were testing?  Were none of these issues present during FarmCon?  If not, can we have that version instead?  Like come one folks, a lot of the issues we are seeing are minor, but they still should have been fixed before release.  Other issues like not adding strobes to the CV dump body and instead using those lights as clearance lights just shows lack of attention to detail and laziness.\n\nWhile yes, Giants has come a long way, and I do give them props for that, this game is not worth $50.  This game is currently worth half that at best, maybe $29.99 in my opinion.\n\nPlan to try it out later down the road but as it sets it needs time and is unfinished!", "hours": 217, "hoursAtReview": 217, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731882370}, {"text": "[h1] My Farming Simulator 25 Review [/h1]\n\nRating: 6/10\n\nIf you want a short version, here it is: I wouldn't buy it at this stage. The game is heavily reliant on mods to become more interesting vehicles etc. and there aren't many available right now. It's pretty much the same situation as with most of the recent Farming Simulator games from giants.\n\nFarming Simulator 25 is a solid game, but whether it\u2019s worth the price... I\u2019m not so sure. There are a lot of new features, many of which are good, but the most noticeable change I\u2019ve found is the new \"dirt\" mechanics. This adds a layer of realism, making you really think about things like tire choices to avoid getting stuck or losing traction. It\u2019s a great addition for those who enjoy more strategic elements in the game, but if you\u2019re not interested in this new \"dirt\" feature, the price tag might not be worth it\u2014especially if you already have FS22.\n\nOne thing I do think is much better this time around is the new AI system for employees. The way they handle tasks is smoother and more efficient, which makes managing your farm a lot less of a headache. It\u2019s a much-needed improvement for anyone who hires workers regularly.\n\nI also haven\u2019t tried rice farming yet, so I can\u2019t comment on that aspect of the game. If you\u2019re particularly interested in rice cultivation, it might be worth researching more yourself before diving in.\n\nAnother downside is that modding hasn\u2019t really taken off yet. The game is still mainly made up of un-modded content, so if you\u2019re very interested in mods to enhance the experience, it might be better to wait a bit longer before jumping in. Personally, modding is a big part of my experience with Farming Simulator, so the lack of mods is a downside for me. However, I understand this isn't the game's fault, and I believe that the modding scene will pick up eventually.\n\nFS25 isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s not bad either. There are a few bugs that need to be fixed, but that\u2019s almost expected in today\u2019s gaming world.\n\nIn conclusion, if you don\u2019t care much about the new \"dirt\" mechanics and are bothered by the lack of mods, the game might not justify the price, especially if you already own FS22. But if you're a newcomer or really into the new features, it could still be worth picking up.\n\nRating: 6/10", "hours": 2513, "hoursAtReview": 790, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731969738}, {"text": "HUGE lack of equipment in the store.

So, if I say \"XCOM 2 was the worst game I've ever experienced\", I don't intend for it to compete in a \"when did the traction engine become a 'tractor' way\", but I also want to communicate the sentiment, nonetheless. \n\nXCOM 2 is a turn-based combat tactics game that acts as a sequel to a more coherent version of itself from four years earlier. In the original, a small alien incursion is taking place and XCOM must enforce Earth's immigration laws through a one-world covert campaign that can't be trusted to existing militaries. In the sequel, the aliens have taken over because you canonically lose the first game.\n\nThe playstyle, tactics, and even tech progression is pretty much one to one with the original -- including the fact that you are excavating an Avengers-like dropship to build facilities in place of digging your underground base. You deploy a squad of four to various locations throughout the parts of the world that America thinks are important, and after spending a lot of money in R&D you have the breakthrough that your six-seat flying bus could, once again, have six butts in those seats.\n\nAnswering the question of \"what's the problem\" is a pretty complex task because every area feels like it was rushed or bumbled through in low quality. There is a lot to download, but it doesn't achieve quality, stability, or feel particularly engaging. With 84% positive reviews on Steam, what do people see in it? Is it the tactic mechanics? Apparently not, since only 30% of players even finish the game at all. Multiplayer has been *famously* dead since the year it came out, so not that either. \n\nI think the arc of the campaign is supposed to kinda mirror the military training style of telling you that you're terrible, then after a while, telling you that you're great so you think you *must* be improving. Because the early game is pretty rife with going out and getting 50% of your squad killed, but ending the game with god units that it would be pretty difficult to even wound. I suspect that a lot of people in that \"70% that do not finish the game\" camp play the early part and go \"this game is so varied and challenging!\" but on close inspection, this is just not the case. The later success is because of gear and overpowered abilities, and not any sort of real strategy-learning on your part.\n\nMost of the enemy units have a special ability that is supposed to make them a unique threat, whether it's the sectoid's mind control or the light mech's triple explosive rockets. Now, granted, your own units can have different gear and classes that gives them the same repeat abilities. The difference is that if I'm going to have a unit throw a grenade, there's lots for me to consider. Do I need armour shredding right now? Will it help if I destroy this unit's cover from this direction? Should I save this for if they group up? Will I need a grenade to blast through a wall later?\n\nThe AI has no ability to make these kinds of strategic determinations at all. Enemies use their gimmick ability the first opportunity that you see them, no exceptions. The mechs will always use the rockets turn one, the sectoids always try mind control turn one, the green robot dust man will always use shadowbound turn one. Even if it means that a muton will hit himself and fall through three floors to his literal death, he will absolutely use that grenade on the roof he is standing if you're next to him when he's discovered. It's just maddeningly annoying that every fight works the exact same way with minimal differences. No wonder Alien Hunter's strategy for upping the difficulty was just having the enemy take another turn after your every action.\n\nNarrative-wise, you (the player) are the most powerful human person that has ever lived on planet Earth \u2013 the player of XCOM 1. It turns out that your tactics were so beastly, you were kidnapped so they could use your uniquely brilliant brain to run all the combat simulations for the occupation of Earth, which you did quite handily by yourself. Later on, you alone are able to create the magic portal to the boss's secret underwater base because your superior genes. Like, the moral of the story is pretty clouded here, being somewhere between Star Wars' \"you can accomplish anything if your family line is the chosen one\" and an even cringier form of eugenics.\n\nIn the end, the world is saved because you were able to change linear television programming to show that the aliens were corrupt. Everyone rioted immediately and successfully reclaimed the world with baseball bats because the alien military was too freaked out to shoot them with the guns they were all holding. Thankfully, American politics in 2023 and 2024 has shown us this truly does work and isn't just a liberal pipe dream. No wonder the enemy is themed with socialist realism art styles and XCOM asks you to take a selfie at the end of every mission.\n\nMeanwhile, though XCOM 1 was \"Enemy Unknown\", XCOM 2 is \"Unknown how the Unreal Engine was made this unstable.\" My computer with an SSD, Ryzen CPU, and pretty high end GPU still takes 45s to a minute to load every mission, the intro cut scenes to those missions being so glitchy you can only see a few frames of them before you cut to the ground. This was true at the time of launch, but running much better hardware eight years later, nothing has changed. Every action that one of your units take still ends with 5-10 seconds of locked camera but nothing happening.\n\nThe hilarious part about the loading process is that there's a special scene of your squad flying in the drop ship that's clearly supposed to be played during loading, but it doesn't display until after the 45 seconds of black screen with a spinning loading logo loads the actual mission, so when you see the drop ship interior, you immediately have a button to launch the mission. Fortunately the game saves every turn for when it inevitably crashes to desktop and you have to spend a half hour to get it to launch again at all.\n\nThis game is just such a train wreck. And that's not even dealing with how Firaxis brought in the Long War people to do Long War for XCOM 2, then released War of the Chosen to deliver similar content as a paid product while hopelessly breaking Long War's mod in the process. \n\nPraise Jesus Christ I'm finally done with this game and this company.\n\n", "hours": 6665, "hoursAtReview": 6665, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733622680}, {"text": "[h3]The game has been noticeably complicated.

I recently picked it up after they announced Online Play was being shuttered. As such, this review treats Wolcen as a singleplayer experience. \n\nWolcen has a solid foundation. It has decent moment-to-moment gameplay with satisfying combat and movement and decent character progression. The skill tree has an interesting \"rotation\" mechanic, allowing you to rearrange it to suit your needs. Your active skills have modifiers to their behavior that can be freely switched at any time, similar to Diablo 3's skill system. This opens the doors for lots of experimentation and varied behavior in skills. Gear crafting was almost cool, but the complete lack of transparency made it more frustrating to use. Voice acting made the admittedly cliche story much more engaging. The post-game has a cool \"city-builder\" gameplay loop, but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out.\n\nThe progression system's negatives begin to show themselves in the endgame. Many mechanics like multiple projectiles don't work properly, pets are an after thought, a loot filter is sorely needed, and leveling past 70 is a snooze without using cheats. Most stats are \"score based\" in their design, meaning they become less effective at higher level zones to artificially increase the difficulty by making your character weaker. Your crit/resistances/dodge rate/ailment application all get less effective the more you progress, bricking builds that rely on them. Enemy resistances also scale this way, with no way to shred them, which makes life leech less and less effective as you progress. You also cannot swap weapon sets, or save loadouts for skills/transmogrification, which would have been a great QoL addition.\n\nThere's a lot holding back Wolcen technically. The final cutscene of the game fails to load, skipping you to the credits. The UI doesn't always behave, where you can't pick up items or select certain UI elements, sometimes locking you in a menu. Animations are rough around the edges. The difficulty of the campaign needed to be cranked up a ton. It just got boring quickly even on max difficulty, despite the scenarios and maps being fairly well done. \n\nFor most people, I don't recommend picking up Wolcen.

Early on this game was a mix of exploration, crafting and improving your skills. It was jank, sure, but the gameplay loop was solid. Using skills improved them naturally over time. Level ups were gained both by killing zombies and using skills, and said levels could be used for some nice buffs, and to unlock techs. And quests existed as a side option for even better loot.\r\n\r\nThen the developers decided exploration was MANDATORY. Now the game is 100% about exploration, \"dungeon exploring\" and quests. Skills no longer improve by using them; instead you have to find books. At certain book intervals you get access to new tech. Baseline tech was HEAVILY nerfed, so you basically can't make anything until you find a certain number of books. Leveling up via skills is no longer viable, so you have to kill zombies and do quests to do so. Thing is, leveling up barely matters anyway, because they only provide minor buffs to specific things and my god do you level up so slow that it barely feels like it matters.\r\n\r\nWhich means if you want to be able to craft, you know, the premise of the game, you have to explore and use the quest system to get enough books to do so. Thing is, the quest system is so boring. Fetch quests, dig up a certain location quests, kill all zombies at a location. Oh boy isn't it great that they decided to shove this dull nonsense down our throat?\r\n\r\nEvery pre-fab building is considered a \"dungeon\" and when you get close enough zombies just spawn right on top of you. Dungeon exploring CAN be okay, but it feels less like exploring an actual zombie apocalypse and more like going through some 8 year old's attempt at a labyrinth. Yes, Timmy, zombies breaking through the wall and falling down from the ceiling IS cool, but it's just annoying when LITERALLY EVERY HOUSE does this. I don't feel like I'm clearing a building when I enter somewhere now, I fell like I'm wadding through a scripted encounter, just hoping the next GOTCHA moment doesn't actually catch me off guard.\r\n\r\nAnd aside from disliking the change in direction, combat is just... its just so bad. Stealth archer route can be fine (be prepared to yell \"how did that miss?\" a lot though), but in what world should zombies LURCH FORWARD when you bash them in the skull with a bat? Knockback seeming works in reverse in this game. Combat was never great, but when its highlighted by being thrown at you so often due to the structure of the game, it gets on your nerves far more.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is just the downside of getting involved with a game during its Alpha.

If you disagree, that's totally fine. Now, onto the review.\n\nThe Game\nThe game itself is decent, but for how old it is, it\u2019s shockingly unoptimized. The graphics look like they were made by a 3-year-old, and the performance is terrible at times. I have an RX 7800 XT and a Ryzen 7 7600X\u2014not exactly low-end hardware. My PC can run most modern games on medium to high settings without a problem. Yet, in this game, I sometimes drop below 60 FPS in big cities, even on max settings.\n\nFor a \u20ac44 game, this level of optimization is unacceptable. I can\u2019t even imagine how people with lower-end PCs manage to play. It\u2019s frustrating because the gameplay and core concept aren\u2019t bad at all. If the developers prioritized better optimization and more frequent, substantial updates, this game could be great.\n\nWhat\u2019s even funnier is how the modding community has done a better job than the actual developers. Mods like Darkness Falls completely outshine the base game. The amount of effort and creativity modders bring to the table makes it clear how much potential the game has.\n\nThe Developers (TFP)\nThe Fun Pimps (TFP) deserve some criticism. First off, they\u2019ve made a lot of promises they never delivered on, like bosses and raiders. On top of that, they seem to limit how players can enjoy the game. For example, they nerfed the ability to fly through horde nights with a gyrocopter by adding flying enemies. I get that it might seem too \"cheesy,\" but why take away creative options?\n\nEven worse, they\u2019ve reportedly said they dislike horde bases\u2014the very thing that makes the game fun for a lot of people. Building and defending a fort during hordes is the best part of the game! Running around aimlessly during a horde just isn\u2019t fun, and if I had to do that, I\u2019d probably stop playing altogether.\n\nThe Verdict\nIf you enjoy survival games with hordes and plan to play mods, get this game\u2014but only on sale or through a cheaper site like G2A. At its current price of \u20ac44, it\u2019s a joke. Honestly, the modding community has created a better game experience than the developers. At this point, TFP should just hand over development to the fans who actually know how to make the game enjoyable.\n\nAvoid buying at full price. Wait for a discount.\n\n", "hours": 9131, "hoursAtReview": 9131, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733688895}, {"text": "This game is very intriguing, I like the vast world, and how the progress of the game differs where you live/Classes/weapons and how far you are in the game.

While it\u2019s a game from the same minds that brought us Dark Souls, don\u2019t go into it thinking it\u2019s just another Soulslike \u2014 it\u2019s not, and I think that\u2019s what makes it so wild.\r\n\r\nFirst off, forget stamina bars and RPG elements; they don\u2019t exist here. There\u2019s no leveling up your stats, no changing armor for different buffs, and you\u2019re not going to find a sweet spot for magic builds or heavy weapon setups. This is pure, unfiltered skill-based combat, and if that sounds intimidating, well... it is. But it\u2019s also what makes Sekiro such a standout.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve gotta be honest: the combat is what\u2019s going to make or break this game for most people. You\u2019ve got one sword and a whole lot of grit, and that\u2019s pretty much it. The core of the gameplay is all about attacking and parrying. It\u2019s super focused, and that\u2019s intentional. From Software knew exactly what they were doing by designing each fight to challenge your mastery of this single skill set. At first, I found it pretty brutal. There\u2019s no fallback to a ranged build or summonings \u2014 it\u2019s just you and your katana, one-on-one with whatever nightmare is staring you down. But once you get the hang of parrying, deflecting, and the glorious Mikiri Counter, the combat transforms from punishing to exhilarating.\r\n\r\nThe posture system is where Sekiro really sets itself apart. Unlike most games where you\u2019re chipping away at a health bar, here you\u2019re breaking down an enemy\u2019s posture. Every parry, deflect, and attack fills up their posture gauge, and when it\u2019s maxed out, you\u2019re rewarded with a death blow that can end the fight or push them to the next phase. It\u2019s so satisfying that I\u2019d argue it\u2019s one of the best mechanics From Software has ever come up with.  One thing to keep in mind: attacking is still important because a lower health bar means you\u2019re going to deal more posture damage. So, finding that balance between pressing your attack and keeping up with deflections is key. It\u2019s a dance, and when you nail it, it feels absolutely incredible.\r\n\r\nNow, the game has its lows as well, the steep learning curve is real, and some fights had me on the edge of rage-quitting. But even at my most frustrated, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that every death was my fault. The combat is precise, and it rewards practice and timing like nothing else. It\u2019s the type of game where you can come back a week later, fight the same boss, and suddenly it clicks because you\u2019ve gotten better.\r\n\r\nTL;DR; If you\u2019re into From Software games and want to test your skills with a fresh take on combat, Sekiro is a must-play. It\u2019s a game that\u2019ll have you cursing your reflexes one minute and feeling like an unstoppable sword master the next. And that\u2019s the magic of it. Absolutely recommended. Just know what you\u2019re getting into \u2014 this isn\u2019t your typical Souls game, and that\u2019s kind of the best part. 9/10", "hours": 2965, "hoursAtReview": 2965, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731870635}, {"text": "Fantastic combat system, even better than elden ring", "hours": 4460, "hoursAtReview": 1460, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731866479}, {"text": "Peak souls game after Bloodborne.

You lose half your gold and XP on death, with a CHANCE of that not happening, which is diminished by each death, making dying even more punishing then before.

That would be all cool IF bigger sized enemies would flinch to your attacks. But they don't, unless you get in a counter hit.

While it doesn\u2019t entirely revolutionize its genre, Outriders delivers enough to stand out, despite a few shortcomings.\n\nStory and Setting\nOutriders is set on the planet Enoch, a distant world humanity seeks to colonize after Earth becomes uninhabitable. Players take on the role of an Outrider, an elite soldier caught in the chaos as humanity's colonization efforts are thrown into disarray. After a mysterious storm known as the Anomaly devastates the settlers, you are cryogenically frozen and reawaken decades later in a world where the survivors have devolved into a brutal, factional society.\n\nThe story leans heavily on sci-fi tropes but manages to stay engaging through its darker tone and twists. The game's narrative explores themes of survival, power struggles, and humanity's resilience. While some dialogue feels overly dramatic or clich\u00e9d, the story\u2019s pacing and character arcs provide enough depth to keep you invested.\n\nGameplay\nCombat Mechanics\nThe hallmark of Outriders is its aggressive, fast-paced combat. Unlike many cover-based shooters, Outriders encourages players to abandon traditional cover mechanics in favor of a more dynamic playstyle. Each of the four classes (Devastator, Pyromancer, Technomancer, and Trickster) has unique abilities, ranging from summoning seismic shockwaves to teleporting behind enemies for melee attacks. This blend of gunplay and abilities feels immensely satisfying, offering tactical variety and a sense of empowerment.\n\nThe game rewards aggression through a mechanic where players heal by inflicting damage, encouraging a proactive and visceral playstyle. This system fosters intense combat encounters that feel rewarding and challenging.\n\nLooter-Shooter Mechanics\nAs a looter-shooter, Outriders delivers a plethora of weapons, armor, and mods that cater to various builds. The loot system feels generous, and the ability to tweak and upgrade gear adds a layer of customization that ensures your playstyle evolves over time. Legendary items and synergistic mods amplify the sense of progression, making grinding feel rewarding.\n\nHowever, loot drops can sometimes feel uneven, especially in the early-to-mid game, which may frustrate players who want consistent upgrades.\n\nMultiplayer and Co-Op\nOutriders truly shines in its co-op gameplay. The classes are designed to complement one another, with abilities that synergize well in group combat. Whether you're creating area-of-effect havoc with a Pyromancer or tanking damage with a Devastator, teamwork feels impactful.\n\nThat said, multiplayer has its downsides. Connection issues and server instability were prominent at launch, though these have been mostly addressed through patches. Playing solo is also viable, but the game\u2019s difficulty spikes can feel punishing without the strategic advantages of a team.\n\nGraphics and Performance\nThe visuals in Outriders are solid, though not groundbreaking. The environments range from lush forests to barren wastelands, each with unique design elements. While the art direction is commendable, the graphics can feel dated compared to modern AAA titles. Texture pop-ins and occasional glitches detract from immersion.\n\nOn PC, performance is largely stable, though optimization issues persist on some setups. Players with mid-tier hardware might experience frame drops during intense combat sequences, but the game offers a range of settings to fine-tune performance.\n\nReplayability and Endgame\nThe endgame content, dubbed the Expeditions, challenges players with increasingly difficult missions designed to test optimized builds. These provide a compelling reason to replay and grind for better gear, though the repetitiveness of the missions may wear thin over time.\n\nDespite its strong start, the game lacks a live-service model. While this ensures a complete experience at launch, it also limits the game\u2019s longevity compared to other looter-shooters like Destiny 2 or The Division 2.\n\nStrengths\nEngaging Combat: Unique blend of gunplay and abilities encourages aggressive gameplay.\nClass Variety: Four distinct classes with diverse playstyles.\nRewarding Loot System: Gear customization and modding enhance the experience.\nCo-Op Focus: Team-based synergy feels impactful.\nWeaknesses\nStory Delivery: Some clich\u00e9d dialogue and uneven pacing.\nPerformance Issues: Occasional glitches and optimization problems.\nRepetitive Endgame: Limited endgame diversity for long-term players.\nVerdict\nOutriders is an ambitious title that successfully combines looter-shooter mechanics with RPG elements and a compelling sci-fi narrative. While not without flaws, it delivers a satisfying core experience bolstered by strong combat and co-op mechanics. It\u2019s an excellent choice for players seeking a non-live-service looter-shooter with a complete package at launch.\n\nScore: 8/10\nIf you can overlook minor technical issues and crave adrenaline-fueled action, Outriders is worth your time.", "hours": 2217, "hoursAtReview": 2179, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731991500}, {"text": "This game initially shows some promise but quickly and yet progressively falls apart.\n\nAn immediate problem is that it is not finished. You have a minimap that doesn't really work properly without even a north marker that I can see. You have a system to give you a path to the next objective that is massively broken often leading you the wrong way and to nothing. Then you have issues with multiple monitor and the sound bugging out so that you get digital flatulence. Later in the game there appear to be resources that have been added in terms of gameplay but not on the UI. There are also a few issues with rendering such as characters holding invisible guns or having a grenade stuck to your hand. In one later level I was shot up into the air and then walking around on an invisible platform.\n\nThe random loot mechanic and skill tree don't quite hit the mark either. It's a lot of hassle for the sake of hassle. It tends to invoke the paradox of choice where the more choice you have the less choice you have. To a certain degree a lot of it become useless as long as you choose something and keep levelling up your gear.\n\nThe acting in the game is extremely cliche and cheesy. It's a cinematic style of acting with far too much posturing and trying to be cool but ultimately ending up as nothing but fake and you know what. There is a lost of posing that's frankly embarrassing. It copies a lot of Americanisms from trash television culture. It not original.\n\nThe story is a mess and devolves the further you get into it. People dying without need. It's derivative and just doesn't really fit together. It has one or two good ideas but doesn't pull through. These are not really good ideas from the author. They're common concepts that are widely known and talked about.\n\nFor the rest of the story it just rips off the slave trade, Exodus, Planet of the Apes/Moreau's Island, the Holocaust and Pocohontos/Avatar/Gaia in a way that just doesn't fit well together. It's also boring. These are social issues that everyone has heard of. They're not really good story writing material. In a sense it makes the game Woke only I'm not sure directly or intentionally so. I think the writers were not really that inspired as their story is cobbled together from all of the things you hear people talk about a lot in mainstream culture. The issue isn't as simple as it reusing these various ideas, it's that it has little else, it's not the same as being inspired but instead merely off the top of the head stuff and it's not weaved together into a coherent or compelling story.\n\nI'm a writer myself. I sometimes write short Science Fiction stories and do a bit of world building. I'm not great at it. It's hard to put together a good story. I don't know how to explain it concisely but there is something people do that is a common mistake, a childish mistake that shows a lack of real understanding. That is to have this mentality of creating something new by just selecting a bunch of other things and saying you want something that's all of those together as though it's possible to just throw a bunch of seemingly good ingredients into a pot and then for that to just magically work as a recipe. It talks a hell of a lot more for things to come together to make up an integral story and this game fails in that and becomes a bag of ideas or references rather than comprising a whole.\n\nThere are many other things wrong with the game though to go through it all would take quite some time.

Outriders is a third person looter shooter. I have very mixed feelings for this game. I like the concept and some of the lore/story but it is held back by a mediocre gameplay loop. First thing is I've never really liked looter shooters (I made an exception for this game because I liked what I saw from gameplay videos). I find them to be like eating ice cream for every meal as a kid. At first you think it is the best thing ever but over time you really get sick of it. Constantly trading armor & weapons because there is always items that have better stats by what you just picked up ten minutes ago. The dopamine kick wears off for me quickly. While there is a system that lets upgrade your favorite items it comes at heavy cost of resources to grind. \n\nI know a big selling point was about being about to co-op the game with people but I feel like that idea is push by the game aggressively. While you can solo the game all the way through, like I did, the game jumps massive difficulty spikes. Either by a absurd amount of enemies or fighting waves of bullet sponges. The game is not balanced at all for a single player nor does it really compensate for solo play. This is very evident in the Expeditions. Expeditions are basically your dungeon crawls for better loot but it throws an abundance of enemies at you as if you were playing in a full party. They're extremely infuriating. Take this in to account where no one is really playing this game. There were times have I tried to join random Expedition teams only to be met with no games to be found several times.\n\nThe positive I do like about the game is the powers. You have four classes to choose from. Technomancer (long range with use of gadgets & support). Pyromancer (medium range class) and your two close range classes. Trickster (hit & run type) and Devastator (Tank. The class I went with) I don't know how other classes function but I think I have an idea. The Devastator has several powers but there were only three that I actively used which are the first three you unlock. Even being the tank class I got to parts of the game where I was being overwhelmed by enemies with massive difficulty spikes. More frustration met by being stun locked in situations.\n\nThere is a world tier system. Which is something you level up and by leveling up to the next tier enemies get tougher but at the cost of getting better loot. You can choose to beat the entire game sitting at the lowest tiers and you may have to lower tiers in certain situations. Mostly for bosses who become so much of a sponge because it is compensating for a full party rather than a single player.\n\nI can maybe recommend the game on sale and if you can get some friends together to play. If you want to choose to pursue a solo run please keep in mind what I've talked about.

Different from most of the modern card/turn based strategy games, this game has almost no RNG (except the coinflip in the beginning of each match, and randomized advanced units, which are the same for both side), and all information is open to both side, so calculation and prediction play very very important role here.\n\nThe learning curve is somehow steep. More or less like a good RTS game, there are things to memorize: common openings, tricks and trades... But luckliy, there are very good articles about these aspects already: google Prismata library.

It is for those people who like rigorous strategy and calculation, and hate the gamble effect RNG brings. A very unique game, also well polished. And somehow to my surprise, the in game chat and the community is very friendly, helpful and very warmful towards new players. \n\n", "hours": 25534, "hoursAtReview": 14499, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1525280525}, {"text": "This game is the absolute pinnacle of turn-based strategy. It is really a surprise I only heard about this game now, a few days after the release on steam, even though the game has existed for over 3 years I heard. And why you definitely SHOULD buy this game? Here are a few examples of my reasons behind my decision to get Prismata:\n- I like chess, I've played HS, Gwent, Duel of Champions, Fire Emblem and loads of other different turn based strategy games, but I have never come across anything like Prismata before. The combination of no RNG(apart from coinflip, which has around the same effect as chess) and very complex game mechanics which need to be perfectly executed or you literally can lose instantly, really creates a very competetive and interesting game environment, where you always feel you can improve gameplaywise after any given game.\n- Prismata has been made super-indie, by only a couple of people and because of that has a completely different mindset compared to for example Duel of Champions, which is another game I also loved, although it was shut down by Ubisoft. The developers have clearly emphazised how much it means for them to create a no-p2w environment where you don't have to grind for the cards, or anything, although this is not a card game but a resource management game. Completely opposed to for example the \"pay until you are broke\" - method which sounds like to be the monetization option for Valve's newest \"strategy\" game Artifact and many other similar games in 1v1 strategy genre in general.\n- The developers have come up with a really clever solution to prevent the game from every getting solved, or repetitive, as the available \"card\" pool for both players is partly randomized every game. And yes for both players means both players have the same options, in every game, negating most balance issues with cards being overpowered or too weak, as you cannot choose what to take with you ingame.\n- The lack of deckbuilding was a weird thought for me at first, but it actually is the perfect solution for any game like this. The reason why card games or other strategy games which involve deck building of some kind get tiresome rather quickly, unless new cards are added very often, which has its own issues with balancing and older cards getting useless and price for new players etc. Although I repeat, this is NOT a card game even though it maybe might seem like one when you take a first look at the UI, I feel that comparisons to popular card games work well with this game, as the strategy is in the end somewhat similar, just without the surprise factor of your opponent having a hand you cannot see. When the options are open to inspection for both players, the mindgames really kick in. And as every game is different and you have to figure out a new strategy for every given game, and also look out for what your opponent is doing, the game will never feel stale!\n- Since steam release although the success isn't like HS level, I have had no trouble finding opponents when queueing. Also the AI is really challenging and the single player missions are already so difficult that it feels like they have a lot more content than they  actually do, funnily enough. I like the art style of the game even though I have seen many people calling it \"cheap\" or \"mobile like\", but tbh I think for such a small development team the art style is more than good enough, and main plus I'd say every unit at least feels unique and distinct, thanks to the artwork.\n- Main positive is the mechanics though, but explaining all those in a single review might take a little too long, but I just say that after turn one, literally anything is possible. The units have cool combos and setting up situations where you will end up ahead in the long run is crucial to winning any game, and the key is WHEN to do things or not.\n\nNegatives:\n-Price of the game can feel a bit high (around 21\u20ac for me with the first DLC) but it did feel worth it for me after I played a while. The game will likely be free to play some point but I wouldn't wait for it as the founder edition has some cool bonuses, like letting you unlock the various skins and other cosmetics for the units a lot easier. Talk about supporting a great game!\n- The skill ceiling is REALLY HIGH, like yeah this game is not for everyone, it can feel overwhelming without any experience about these kind of strategy games, and it will take a while even for more experienced puzzle solvers like me to get the hang of it. But if you feel like you are up for a challenge, you will get it.\n- If you require GWENT level of art, then maybe this game is not for you.", "hours": 6704, "hoursAtReview": 1596, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1521226875}, {"text": "Summary:  Prismata is turn-based Starcraft meets Magic: the Gathering.  It's recommended if you like the resource management and build optimization of Starcraft, but find unit micromanagement frustrating.  Also recommended if you like the tactical gameplay of Magic: the Gathering, but dislike the cost of collecting cards and dislike games being determined by which player draws the right cards.\n\nPros: \n- Deep and unique strategic gameplay\n- All players on an even playing field\n- Every game plays out differently\n- Excellent, non-cheating AI with a broad range of difficulties\n- Rich support for competitive play\n- Very affordable\n\nCons:\n- Small, hardcore playerbase\n- Sometimes makes me feel dumb\n- Skins only obtainable through a microtransaction slot machine\n\nPrismata is one of those rare genre-innovator games for which it is difficult to make direct comparisions to other games, but which is, in retrospect, surprising that something similar hasn't been done before.  The best summary is \"Starcraft, the card game.\"\n\nOver the course of a match, you and your opponent will take turns building units by spending resources in exchange for playing cards to form a tableu of units, selecting some units to attack your opponent, and managing your defenses.  However, instead of playing units from a hand of cards, they are built from a card pool which allows all units to be built at any time, provided you have the required resources available.  This unit pool of fifteen to twenty-two units is randomly generated at the start of each match from a library of more than one hundred options, changing the optimal strategy each game, and rewarding the player more able to adapt their own strategy to the available choices.\n\nThe units themselves are purchased using five different categories of resources.  At the start of a match, you start with two engineers, which produce energy, and a handful of drones, which produce gold.  (The first player gets six drones, and the second player gets seven.)  You can use energy to produce more drones, and use gold to purchase other units and structures.  These structures produce additional red, green and blue resources, which are further required to buy more advanced units.\n\nSome units are purely economic, others can attack your opponent, others defend against attacks, and some can do both.  Many of the more expensive units have an ability which you can choose to activate once a turn, perhaps spending some resources, perhaps making that unit unavailable to defend, in exchange for some positive effect.  The five categories of resources, the wide variety of units with unique effects, and the attacking and defending phases bring to mind Magic: the Gathering as a gameplay comparison.  However, unlike Magic, the same units are available to both players during the game, and unlike Magic, there is no need to buy card packs in order to get access to units.\n\nBecause the only randomness during the match is the selection of units available, and because the same units are available to both players, the winner of a match is determined only by he who makes the best decisions.  This can be very rewarding when you win, but when you lose, there isn't anything to blame but your own poor performance.  This isn't Hearthstone, where you can shift the blame to the random number generator.  This isn't League of Legends, where you can scapegoat your teammates.\n\nThe high learning curve of Prismata and lack of random elements means that acquiring the skills required to succeed against other players can be a frustrating experience.  This is particularly the case because the player population is somewhat small, with less than two hundred players online at any given time, and quite hardcore.  If you are the sort of player that is easily frustrated by losing, this may not the game for you.  However, if you respond to a losing streak by trying to analyze your mistakes and attempt to \"git gud\", to put it in the parlance of our subculture, then Prismata will be a rewarding.\n\nThe game does provide the tools for improving your performance.  There is a replay system allow you to review your mistakes and do \"what-if\" scenarios to see if different decisions would have led to better results.  You can also spectate top-level players in-game, making the game itself a rich environment to learn from the best.\n\nMitigating the initially brutal multiplayer experience is a lengthy set of single-player battle training missions.  These missions walk you through available tactics and strategies for effective Prismata play.  You can expect to spend twenty hours or more progressing through the single player content.  Also available is a very capable AI opponent, with many difficulty settings, which should allow anyone to find the right level of challenge.  \n\nCurrently, Prismata is available through Steam for $25 USD, and the value for dollar at that price point is very generous.  However, be aware that Prismata will, in the future, be a free-to-play game with microtransactions.  The full gameplay experience will be available for free.  Whales will be on even footing with the completely free-to-play player.\n\nHowever, skins for your units are acquired through a microtransaction slot machine which seems optimally designed to bilk the potential problem gambler.  A trifecta of exploitation makes this so:  difficult to estimate probabilities, cognitive biases about loss aversion, and an in-game currency creating psychological distance from real-world dollar value.  Of course, these skins are cosmetic only, providing no in-game advantage, so you are free to ignore them entirely.  But the process of acquiring skins does feel a little slimey.  I'd strongly prefer directly spending money on skins, instead.\n\nIf you are interested in Prismata, I would recommend buying in at the asking price on Steam, since it does give you extra single player content, but if you are unwilling to pay the asking price and can't wait for the free-to-play roll out, be aware that sometimes streamers on Twitch have keys to give to new players, and apparently there is a Discord where you can ask for a key and get one.

It's worth your time.", "hours": 51583, "hoursAtReview": 29813, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1561998356}, {"text": "The easiest way to describe Prismata is to call it a RTS-themed (think Starcraft) chess. Chess comparison comes from the fact it has 0 RNG of any kind and no hidden info so the game is deterministic i.e. one of the players has a guaranteed win based on the starting positions. But just like Chess, Prismata is incredibly complex where solving it is impossible.\n\nPlayers start with 6 or 7 Drones that harvest gold (2nd player starts with 1 extra drone to compensate), gold buys you technology structures that produce blue/red/green resources (not official names, but that's the accepted naming convention in the community). Subsequently gold and tech resources buy attackers/defenders and your goal is to kill opponent's units while protecting your fragile drones and attackers. Sounds simple at its core.\n\nThe biggest draw to Prismata IMO is the fact that even though it is deterministic, games play out completely differently each time and you aren't required to memorize openings like in a game like Chess. This is achieved by giving players random units each game (There's about 100 units in the random unit pool right now and each game you get 5-11 random ones, 8 being the number for standard 'tournament' mode). \"Wait, didn't you say there is no RNG?\". Yes and I wasn't lying - even though the units change, they are mirrored for both players! Once the game starts, nothing will depend upon RNG determining the outcome, it's up to your and your ability to come up and execute a superior strategy. A unit may be super good in a particular set of units, but get completely countered in another - figuring out which strategy to choose is a challenging but fun task. \n\nAnother cool part is that players don't own the \"cards\" (units), all the units are available to everyone in competitive PvP mode so there's absolutely 0 gameplay advantage to paying players (they can get some sweet cosmetics though!). This also means that devs have no qualms about balancing units - no one can complain that their cards got nerfed so devs can act swiftly and keep the balance at the top notch state.\n\nIf talking about the cons of the game graphics definitely stand out - the art may seem a bit \"cheap\" and the play screen may seem bland and generic. It obviously has a lot to do with the fact that developing team is small (3-5 people) and don't have a huge budget, but it's also because devs favour functionality and clarity over flashiness. The gamestate in Prismata can get rather complex with nearly 100 units on each side in some cases so unnecessary animations/flashy effects would slow down the game and clutter the screen.\n\nAnother downside to a lot of players may be that the game has no comeback mechanics, if you fall behind and your opponent overwhelmed you, you dont have a path to counter him most of the time - the game snowballs. So an early mistake or inefficiency in your build may easily get punished down the line by good players. The upside of this though is that if you see you are clearly behind, there's no need to wait until you \"bleed out\", you can concede and move on to the next game, trying not to repeat the same mistake again in the future. In some games with uncertainity/hidden info sometimes you know you have only 5% chance to win, but you sort of have to stick around for another 15-20 minutes just in case opponent makes a mistake which can be incredibly frustrating.\n\nThe game also has a lot of great features. Replays seems like no brainer in a competitive game, but there's also a super easy way to share replays with other players through a replay code. This coupled with the fact that the game has 0 hidden info means there's no secret strategies to hide, you can very easily find replays of top players and see how they played a certain set. You can also spectate games very easily, like the top players playing on the ladder live. Another amazing feature is the ability to analyze a game - if you think you made a mistake at some point, you can go to that part of the replay and open it in analysis mode to play out the game from both players sides and see whether a different line of play might have changed the outcome.\n\nOverall Prismata is a unique strategy game with very deep and challenging gameplay if you decide to see past the bland exterior and decide to actually try it.", "hours": 58888, "hoursAtReview": 2952, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1521213851}, {"text": "Since this is going f2p in a few hours, here my review.\n\nI bought Prismata Early Access in spring this year after seeing a video about it and it was worth every cent!

Prismata is very much like an abstract variant of a Starcraft mirror match, but with some key differences.\n\nPros:\n\n* Decent singleplayer content consisting of a Campaign with a cheesy story that serves to teach the player the basics of Prismata, while also offering optional challenges that a skilled player can choose to take on. There's also a variety of preset Combat Training missions separate from the Campaign, designed to teach specific concepts to make you a better player. Finally, there's also some badges to unlock via achievements, and those achievements are a mix of lifetime milestones (earn X gold, build X units) and challenges (beat a training mission designed around using X unit to win...without actually building that unit!)\n\n* Bot support is well above the norm for a strategy game where both sides have similar starts, with no handicapping. I think its fair to say that the better bots are at the level of at least an Intermediate player, with a wide variety of less skilled variants for the Beginner player to practice on. There's also a Casual matchmaking mode where you can opt-in or opt-out of facing these bots, if you prefer that to a Custom Match.\n\n* I am still far from an experienced player, but as far as I can tell, Prismata is fairly well balanced. In any given match there is likely to be a slightly favored player (often whoever goes second), but due to the uniqueness of each match (a base of 11 units in every game, plus up to 11 more from a random pool of 97+ units), it is difficult to identify the \"correct\" lines to take. Often Prismata is about who makes the fewest mistakes, because both players are likely to make several over the course of a game.\n\n* While Prismata was funded by kickstarter at one point, a new player is still eligible to buy in at similar/same tiers via Steam Early Access. $25 USD is considered the Engineer tier, for example. Benefits over the eventual F2P version are almost all either cosmetic or bonus singleplayer content and none of it is pay-to-win, though it should be noted that the Golden/Platinum Tickets can be used as pay-to-complicate in the Ranked Ladder. They increase the odds at the start of a match for up to three additional random units to be added to the unit pool (which starts at either 8 or 5 units, whichever you queue for). This isn't an advantage persay, and players can disable that part of the ticket if they wish, but it is a match-influencing effect that F2P players will have limited access to.\n\n* The UI is very functional. There's a hotkey for almost everything, and many (but not all) of those hotkeys can be reassigned.\n\n* Soundtrack. While not extensive in quantity, the quality of the soundtrack is pretty high. I'm less impressed with the sound effects, but that could just be personal preference, as I tend to turn the sound effects slider down in most games.\n\n* Runs on toasters. I don't have a toaster (i7-4770k stock with MSI 1080Ti stock), but I can comfortably run Prismata mirrored on two screens while running a Twitch stream on a third and not run into performance issues.\n\nCons:\n\n* Lack of playerbase.

The hope is that this will change once Prismata adds a F2P option, but that is month(s) off in the distance and it is yet to be seen if Prismata will grab a F2P audience. I cannot comment on the quality of matchmaking at this time as I am still improving vs bots, but the playerbase appears to be a mix of veterans (who had access for years before Steam Early Access) and new players (who bought in during Steam Early Access). Considering that and considering that not all of the players online are queuing the same ladder if they're queuing a ladder at all, there's likely pockets of mmr where very few players reside.\n\n* Always online. You will need an internet connection, even if you are playing the singleplayer content, playing against a bot, or reviewing a replay. This has been mentioned to the devs (the idea of an Offline Mode), but isn't considered a priority at this time.\n\n* Time controls. This can be a pro or a con depending on the player, but if you are playing on the Casual Ladder, Ranked Ladder, or Event mode, you will be subject to a timer. In Casual that timer cannot be configured and is always 60s, in Ranked you can queue any combination of 90s/60s/45s/30s/20s/12s/6s (quicker time controls are given priority if you queue multiple and anyone else is also queuing that time control in your mmr range), and Event mode varies daily but is typically 12s or 6s. Additionally, you get a timebank that starts at the same value as your time-per-turn, and it increases by 25% of your unspent time-per-turn.\n\nFor many players, this isn't an issue. If you use hotkeys, submitting a turn is a matter of seconds. And if you're a quick thinker, many of these options will feel slow to you. 45s is considered the competitive standard (used in standard tournaments), and much of the current userbase queues some combination of 60s/45s/30s. However, if you were considering buying Prismata because you want the joy of resource management without the pain of APM/fast thinking, this may not be the game for you. You do have the option of creating private matches with friends or bots, and those matches can have timers disabled, but any mode involving matchmaking has a timer attached.\n\n* Graphics. Its an indie game, made on an indie budget. This isn't a Blizzard/Electronic Arts/Ubisoft/etc title. The interface is clear at 1080p, though I wouldn't want to run it too much lower than say 720p.\n\nOverall:\n\nRecommended, but only if you are part of Prismata's target audience. This is a strategy game that encourages quick, deep thinking during most parts of a match, and while there is something here to enjoy for all skill levels, the focus is on players who are striving to be the best. If that isn't you, consider waiting until the F2P version comes out, or consider trying the Steam Free Weekend that is speculated to happen sometime during April 2018.\n___\n\nReview written Mar/27/18, from the perspective of someone who bought in during Steam Early Access.

Also would have liked to see an expansive attachment system, but it's pretty bare bones. \n\nBut the real issue is unacceptable. A life 2.0 is a fat fucking lie. There is no life to this game. The ai is stupid as fuck and just spawns on you all the time, I feel like I'm playing farcry 5. They don't use cover or tactics, they just run at you and die. In the original stalkers the Ai would be wondering around living their lives fighting and camping out. You could spot a group of stalkers getting attacked by dogs 500m away, see only 1 survived and bump into that sole survivor 20 mins later chilling at a fire in a village. In this game the ai just randomly spawn and despawn around you. I don't think you could actually snipe in this game because of it. \n\nThe biggest joke I saw so far was I went to this small military camp. Killed a group of soldiers out from, went in and killed another group at the barracks. While I was looting the guys in the barracks it spawned another group right outside, they spotted me through the walls and bum rushed in to their deaths. This went on for like 7 respawned squads, I just kept stuffing all their loot in a duffle bag inside cause I couldn't hold it all. And they never stopped, 7 wasnt the end because they stopped spawning. It's because I got tired of farming them and left (under fire). And quite frankly it doesn't even seem like they tried to make the Ai good, or made an A-life 2.0. It looks like it was just a marketing gimmick.

One of the defining features of the series was it's living world. NPC's would wander around, fight over territory, and have their own radio chatter about local events. That system is gone now, and replaced with a generic spawning system. \n\nAs an example, I cleared a camp of enemies, looted it, walked a few feet outside of it, and enemies immediately spawned back in, shooting at me. Another example, a friendly group spawned in, helped me fight a mutant, I turned away to open a stash, turned back around, and they were gone.\n\nThere also doesn't seem to be any faction relations, or even randomly generated jobs for other stalkers. The stealth in this game is a joke, with enemies being able to see you through walls and foliage with hawk-like perception, and once they do spot you, they will always know where you are even if you break line of sight. The game, like the older games, warns you to lower your weapon around other stalkers, except in this one, they don't actually care. Equipment wears out incredibly easy, and is very expensive to repair (at least in the early game). For example, I got in 2 gunfights and had to drop 2000-ish to fix up my gun.\n\nNone of this even touches on the bugs, granted, outside of crashes here and there, there hasn't been anything gamebreaking that i've ran into. Just a lot of npc's phasing through floors or levitating, and the combat AI performing some... questionable tactics. The optimization isn't great but it's UE5 so nobody is shocked.

Well, if you recognized my name, my entire Steam account and most of my online handles pay homage to this series. I've been playing Stalker SOC and all of it's sequels and mods since it's release -  long before anyone had ever heard of it or understood why it was so special. I can be a \"wordy\" guy, so I'm going to do my best to try not to slide off into an anomaly of verbosity.\n\nYoung folks who've never played the Stalker games may have a bit of a harder time understanding the Stalker formula and it's atmosphere. You need to understand that Stalker was never about perpetually intense action sequences, colorful, rich, highly-populated worlds filled to the brim with countless entities to interact with. If it were, it wouldn't be the \"The Zone\". Stalker games HAVE to be grim, feel isolated, and without TOO many friends or foes to encounter. It has to paced out, and feel like you genuinely don't know what's around the corner. An enemy faction? Mutant? Intestinal spaghettifying vortex? You don't know.. and you don't want to.\n\nI feel that if you've never played a Stalker game, you may very well be disappointed by what you will inevitably see as a lack of innovation in Stalker 2. I'll staunchly disagree with you though, because if you take a Stalker game and change it too much, or try to turn it into Metro, Fallout, Call of Duty, or Overwatch, you're going to be missing the point entirely and miss the mark. Stalker was amazing because it managed to take a gray, dead, under-populated universe and make it utterly fascinating and intimidating, and they have repeated this formula beautifully in this sequel. \n\nBefore I get into pros and cons, some of you will inevitably be Stalker OG's like myself, and you're wondering if it's still truly Stalker, or if it has been franchised by people trying to sell a game they don't actually care about. I asure you, this is 100 percent S.T.A.L.K.E.R. You can drop 60 bucks now, or wait until later when the price goes down, bugs are worked out, and you have a few mods or DLC to play with. Either way, the soul, love and spirit of the Stalker universe is VERY much in-tact, and aside from quality of life and engine changes, and to the sheer joy of those of us that don't want innovation to alienate a game from it's own universe; there is nothing shockingly new about this game in contrast to it's predecessors. This is a GREAT thing, because it could easily have been ruined by any one of the countless cancerous elements ruining modern game design creatively and socially.\n\nThe story-line, the character you play, and the tone of this game is truly \"Ukrainian\" and I recommend playing English subtitles with it's native audio which is how I played the originals (which were in Russian). There are reasons Russian language is not available but that's a whole different subject. I don't want to give away spoilers, but the dialogue, little subtle humorous quirks (such as a guy you're beating up choking on bread lol) are unique, and every character even in a world where everyone looks the same feels like a real person. So when you play this you won't feel like its literally every other sci-fi, wasteland, story recycled 100 times with modern sensibilities. Nope, there's none of that. This world is pretty masculine, and unabashedly so. \n\n-Bugs\n\nIt's 2024. I've been gaming for 45 years. I've been through it all. Fallout 1, 2 3, NV, Thief, Thief 2, Elder Scrolls, and I don't recall a time we had new games that didn't release with problems. When you consider the sheer scope of a modern open-world game, it actually amazes me seeing how many people cry about this. Not to mention the fact that the developers were repeatedly displaced by a war-torn Ukraine, shifted around, worried sick about their family and friends... honestly it's astounding to me they managed to turn this game out, and somehow still manage to keep it's soul in-tact. The original Stalker dev literally died fighting the Russians in Bahkmut. Hearing the crying about bugs (aside from pointing them out) is actually kind of infuriating. I'm giving them a pass and the good-will that they will fix them.\n\n-You have your usual texture bugs, the occasional glitch, and yes if your system is old, Stalker 2 is probably going to make you adjust your settings. I've encountered only one bug that caused me to restart, having gotten stuck on the bridge when leaving the first zone. \n\n-The AI in terms of combat is great, in fact they're going to piss you off lol. They will come at you, flank you, and you will not feel like you're fighting Skyrim enemies. \n\n-One legitimate critique is that enemies spawn with varying opinions on where they should spawn, and how close or realistically they pop. I've never liked the popping enemies mechanic in any game, but this game is so massive as an interconnected map of zones that they're bound to struggle a bit with the best way to disperse enemies and its another thing I trust they will tweak and rework in time. \n\n-Ballistic/gun issues. For some of you, you're not going to care about this but I am a huge firearms guy. The ballistics and gunplay itself is fine, the problem is that for example; the 9x19 platform weapons somehow do more damage than 45 acp. Somehow the 45 holds more rounds as well...... Im thinking they somehow got the profiles swapped as it should be the exact opposite. The 9mm pistol shoot shoot flatter, go a bit further, hold more rounds but do slightly less damage. No idea if this will be addressed, or if any other weapons have similar problems, im only 30 hours in and just left the first zone. \n\nStalker 2 is Stalker, they haven't reinvented the wheel, and for that I am GRATEFUL. If you can't make a sequel feel like a new and improved addition to it's predecessor, than I think you are better off making a whole new game and probably not the best person to lead a design team for an already established IP. I see this mistake happen again and again and again in the gaming industry. Going from Far Cry 5 to all of the nonsense that came later, is a good example. \n\nStalker 2 is NOT perfect. Neither was Shadow of Chernobyl, Clear Sky, or Call of Pripyat. It's only going to be worked, patched and get better though. If you are someone that doesn't already love and truly understand the originals, I think you're going to be disappointed with this, because at the end of the day, the biggest critique I think you will find from the younger crowd especially is that \"I've played many other games like this already\" and this is a fair critique. But you have to remember, this series is where all those others came from. The world of Chernobyl in Stalker is similar in some ways, but still impressively different from Fallout or Metro. \n\nStalker 2 is a worthy successor, and if you're reading these reviews trying to determine if this game has been bastardized by the modern gaming industry, rest assured, the programmers and devs managed to produce this while their entire world is ripped apart. They absolutely have proven this to be a labor of love. It is left unspoiled by Western politics, or \"social-engineering\". This review is coming from a guy obsessed with the originals, and when they first announced Stalker 2, I had VERY strong reservations it would even be completed, and if it was; I genuinely expected a bad game, marred by store purchase content, and converted for a fleeting multiplayer audience that would quickly get bored, and leave the series cheapened. I could not be more wrong.\n\nI haven't bought a game on release or given a sh!t in a long, long time. I have taken every moment of my free time addicted to this exactly as I was in 2007 making myself late for my chump job and without enough sleep because Shadow of Chernobyl stole it all from me. Ahh, these old boots sure feel good. Luckily for me times are better now. \n\nStalker fans, buy this game already.

Play this with the Ukrainian voice actors on, and just read the English Subtitles. \r\nSecond: You will have to spend a little bit of time tweaking your settings to get good fps, however once I did that I now get consistent 80-100 fps, even in the main town, with most of my settings turned to high/epic thanks to FSR upscaling/Frame generation, and the game feels very natural with these settings on using my 3070. \r\nTHERE WILL BE ALOT OF NEGATIVITY AROUND HOW THIS GAME RUNS THAT WILL RUIN ITS RATING. DO NOT LISTEN TO THOSE REVIEWS, IT TOOK ME LITERALLY 15 MINS TO FIND SETTINGS THAT WORKED FLAWLESSLY FOR ME. \r\n\r\n", "hours": 3647, "hoursAtReview": 274, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732144936}, {"text": "As someone with around 1000 hours on the original 3 Stalker games, this review is going to be biased, although I will try and keep it minimal.  In it's current state, Stalker 2 is unplayable beyond a certain point.\n\nPro:\n\n- The environment, atmosphere and attention to minor details is immaculate.\n\nCons:\n\n- No A-Life system!\n\nThe Stalker series was amazing because of the A-Life system in place.  When entering an area, all NPCs were loaded in and normally would only spawn in if traveling from another area.  In Clear Sky you could actually see all NPC groups on you PDA and watch them wandering about.  Factions engaged in war with each other, mutants terrorized the map and lone Stalkers hunted artifacts.  In Stalker 2 NPCs only spawn, never live.  The spawn points are only near POIs and along major roads.  The NPCs will quite literally spawn in on top of you with no rhyme or reason.  I've cleared rooms to just to be shot in the back as I approach the only entrance to leave.  I've had them continually spawn behind me as I flip back and forth to defend myself.  I have entered seemingly empty POIs only to have them populate after I'm in the center, finding myself completely surrounded.  At the same time I watch NPCs despawn right before my eyes.  This is not so much a horror survival game as it is a bug survival game!\n\n- Game breaking bugs galore!\n\nThe first game breaking bug I encountered was shortly after the prologue\\tutorial.  A NPC died that wasn't supposed to die and my camera locked to where a conversation was supposed to take place and wouldn't unlock.  Loading an earlier save and trying a few more times, the NPC lived and I was able to proceed.  Frustrating but not refund worthy.\nLater in the main story, there are several places you can't get in to that must be entered, doors that refuse to open, quests completed and then seemly fail as you walk away and other assorted bugs.  Most can be bypassed with the use of mods\\console commands but some you are stuck with.  The main issue, which pushed me over the edge just now, is after successfully defending the starting base (and earning an achievement for it), when you leave the are a message plays that it has fallen and upon returning everyone is hostile and the main characters are dead.\nDue to the amount of bugs encountered, it's impossible to tell how many there actually are, how many areas are actually bugged and not simply the way it is designed.\n\n[strike]- Horrible economics!\n\nIn it's current state, the economics make the game nearly unplayable.  The buy/sell ratio is so far off, coupled with the insane cost to repair equipment, it is impossible to earn enough money to keep your arsenal maintained.[/strike]\n\n- Insane weapon and armor degradation!\n\nThis goes hand and hand with the aforementioned economics issue.  All equipped items take environment damage, regardless if actually used.  i.e. my side are routinely requires repair even though is isn't used.  The most I've earned from a mission coupled with the extra made from selling all sellable goods has been around 25k, while the repair cost to my primary weapon alone was 22k.  I used CheatEngine to give myself free money and earned the achievement for spending 1,000,000 dollars within a few hours.  I had only upgraded a couple of suits and a handful of weapons plus repair costs.\n\n- Bullet sponges and invincible enemies!\n\nIn previous titles, harder difficulties meant much deadlier opponents, but at the same time, you too were a force to be reckoned with.  The hardest difficulty on Stalker 2 is Veteran, unlike all the previous title where you could select Master from the start.  On Veteran, most enemies simply become bullet sponges.  I had a Bloodsucker take a dozen shotgun blasts from point blank and still laugh at me.  Several human enemies have take multiple head shots from a AKM.  I had an assumedly glitched enemy take a full clip of head shots  at point blank from a high tier assault rifle plus 5 or 6 rounds from the Saiga 12 to finish off.  This coupled with the extremely high degradation and repair cost is nearly game breaking in my opinion.\n\n- Useless headlamp and no night vision!\n\nStalker is science fiction\\horror game series.  It is supposed to be dark and gloomy but Stalker 2 takes it to another level.  The day\\night cycle is intentionally made to have much longer nights than days and most interior areas are very dark.  Even interior friendly areas are dark.  They are so dark in fact, that you'll almost always have your headlamp on.  The issue is that the headlamp only illuminates a few meter in front of you, making it utterly useless except in very close quarters.  In every other Stalker game, basic night vision was obtainable from fairly early on but in Stalker 2, it seems there is no night vision at all.  The lack of night vision doesn't just make it harder, it makes it nearly impossible to play in certain environments.  NPCs have no problem seeing you in the dark and will pepper you with bullets from the darkness.\n\n- Hyper aware NPCs with aimbot status!\n\nThis goes with the previous issue of no night vision.  NPCs seem to be hyper aware of you presence, even while crouched in the next room with your headlamp off.  The detection meter will fill and NPCs will begin an assault before you make any noise.  In large, dark areas, enemies will seemingly be able to see you through the darkness and will shoot you before you can react.  Outside, it is common for enemies to spawn and detect you from the other side of hills and through structures.  Sometimes they can shoot through solid landscape and other solid objects.  I've had bandits hit me consistently with a sawed off shotgun from 50 meters out.\n\n- It's a dead world....\n\nStalker was fun because it worked to make you feel as though you were living in the Zone.  Stalkers stalked, bandits looted, mutants roamed the land, Duty and Freedom fought to the bitter end.  In Stalker 2, the Zone is dead, not living as its taunted to be.  Without a functioning A-Life system, nothing notable takes place outside of the POIs.  Some of my fondest Stalker memories were of hearing the distant laughter of fellow stalkers in the night, hearing the strum of the guitar in the distance.  I'd approach slowly, trying to determine if it was friend or foe.  Upon the realization is was friends in the distance, I would be over joyed at the respite from the horrors of the Zone that was soon to follow, joining my fellow Stalkers around the fire till the warmth of the morning sun could be felt.  It was the Zone.  Living.  Breathing.\n\nI look forward to editing this review, to changing my thumb from down to up.  I've waited 14 years to enter the Zone again and I'm not giving up on GSC.  I can't begin to imagine the horrors they have faced while in production, the death and loss they have experienced.

The story, the animations, the lore, the oppressive and lonely atmosphere & sound design: the world building is astonishing and almost photo-realistic to the real exclusion zone, a masterpiece in almost every way. The gun-play leaves nothing to be desired and the exploration is rewarding and satisfying. \n\nQuests are both well-written and well-acted and feel extremely rewarding to play and complete. Artifact hunting is fun and deadly, though a tad on the easy side with anomalies giving plenty of time to dive in and out without any risk for a seasoned Stalker.. \n\nLastly, no changes in the environment from Emissions, as Artifacts respawn once a day if collected.\n\nAs a long time S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fan with over 10k hours across the original 3 titles & the Misery Mod combined, I'm a bit flabbergasted, so here come the bugs that should have been hunted down and fixed by the Monolith prior to release.\n\nFor reference, I am running on a PC I custom built myself for 3D Design & VR using mid-tier gear to run high-end gaming efficiently:\n\n- Z390 Aorus Pro Wifi\n- i5-9600K CPU @ 3.70GHz (6 CPUs), ~3.7GHz\n- 16384MB RAM\n- 3060 Ti 8GB RAM\n\nThe game runs flawlessly performance wise Low to Epic on 1080p, though the game sadly, crashes Audio Drivers and causes other games to run at 12-40 FPS until a system restart.\n\nI find no fair reasoning for a company to release such a broken technical mess.\n\nThe game is nigh unplayable for me. I have 127.4 hours on the game, 23 of which are \u2018Compiling Shaders\u2019 and loading to avoid issues.\n\nI have covered literally every inch of the entirety of the zone. 332 Bugs and Glitches to be exact, though for brevity, I will only list the ones that truly need to be fixed.\n\n1. - Crashes when saving the game or exploring.\n\n2. - Memory leaks in Rostok are the most egregious, though every town does this.\n\n3. - Blue-screen at the \u2018In Search of Past Glory X-5 Controller boss room,\u2019Avoid the trigger that forces your eyes to close when you touch the floor, hiding the enemies spawning in: Jump onto the wall ledge on the right \u2192 container \u2192 Run and Jump onto the pillar.\n\n4. - When siding with the Ward, NPC's outside the barricaded Ward Headquarters in \u2018Zalissya\u2019 welcome you in, although you aren't allowed in.\n\n5. - It is extremely obvious that if A-Life ever existed as an implemented feature, it sure never hit the release window. Ai literally spawn in around corners & from behind LITERAL TREES / 5-20 feet away, sometimes popping in my peripheral view while scoped in on enemies & NPC's disappear in front of me in towns, etc. In Prypriat Ai spawns pairs of Blood Suckers 60 seconds after killing the last pair. It gets old, really really fast.\n\n6. - Ai ESP & Wall-Hack, never forgetting where the player is. I've had NPC's turn their guns and shoot at me while the NPC model itself was looking in a completely different direction!\n\n7. - Ai will stop hunting the player, even if an inch from the player, when the player leaves a 50-100 foot radius from where the Ai spawned in.\n\n8. - Ai having no self-preservation: I.e., spawning in front of a Tesla Anomaly at \u2018Malachite Checkpoint\u2019 ; Ai walking into anomaly's at Rostok near any of the POI's.\n\n9. - Soft-locks / sequence break by dropping into X-5 sewer exit via the hole between 'Ahroprom Research Institute' and 'Ahroprom Factory' falling onto the beam.\n\n10. - Soft-locks when climbing up the ladder at Ahroprom Factory and entering the window above the door to get the SSP-99 before being on the X-5 Quest.\n\n11. - Every main quest requiring a keypad code can be hard-locked by sequence breaking if an NPC hasn't given you the code.\n\n12. - Entering Jupiter early Soft-locks the game. This can be done just north of the \u2018High-Capacity Integral-A magazine\u2019 pickup location in Yaniv, slightly to the East of the small compound with the Monolith soldier in a watch tower using a barrel.\n\n13. - Arena Quest in Rostok can be glitched and abused by dropping gear (locker gear, too) on the ground, talking to the NPC, and repeating this until after using the locker by the stairs.\n\n14. - Infinite Money Glitch.\n\n15. - Permanent psi-emission that cannot be quelled by Psi-Blockers from 'A Minor Incident' after aligning the mirrors: Fix by leaving the area quickly.\n\n16. - Permanent psi-emissions (that CAN be temporarily fixed by downing a Psi-Blocker for 1 minute each) from Controllers.\n\n17. - NPC's like Gary from Yaniv do not reappear after fast travel.\n\n18. - Fixing Arch-Anomalies from removing their Point of Interest map marker from the map (or becoming a ? question mark randomly. \n\n19. - Weird Water Arch-Artifact glitched out completely in my game at the Dancing Lights Arch-Anomaly.\n\n20. - South of \u2018WSD Base\u2019 the player can get permanently stuck under the train car by crouching and walking under it.\n\n21. - In Cooling Towers Region, south of the east graveyard, can reach the tower via the truck with the open back in the North East corner and jumping onto the fence. The player cannot get back over the fence.\n\n22. - Gravity Anomaly South of \u2018Pontoon Depot\u2019 and East of 'Lodochka's Lab' on Wild Island has a chance to permanently glitch the artifact under the mesh on the Middle of the Northern Rocks.\n\n23. - East by South-East of the \u2018Zaton Gas Station,\u2019 the \u2018Cave Network\u2019 Fire/Thermal Anomaly has a chance to spawn artifacts under the mesh.\n\n24. - Three Captains mission in Zaton will sometimes glitch out if you keep Beard and Owl alive. To sometimes fix: walk to the Sultansk after hunting down and clearing the 3 assault squads of Mercenaries (idle in their spawns).\n\n25. - Icarus base has a locked door in the Medical Building that has a stash you cannot reach if you don't help the doctor in a specific main mission quest but still get a PDA showing the location.\n\n26. - See above issue with Stashes: In Duga, if you side with the Ward, you will see a stash between \u2018Duga Substation\u2019 and \u2018Duga Comms\u2019 that you cannot reach.\n\n27. - Enemies have a script to spawn in at the \u2018Sphere\u2019 in the Lesser Zone during a main quest mission, they spawn early if you clear the area out before the main mission. Sphere always grants \u2018Clear out a base silently,\u2019 achievement from simply going loud and killing everyone outside the \u2018Sphere\u2019 location.\n\n28. - Military spawn in front of the players at the Military Checkpoints & Army Warehouses, breaking immersion..\n\n29. - SIRCAA has *INSANE* Memory leaks throughout.\n\n30. - See above: \u2018Yantar Production Complex\u2019 in Yantar.\n\n31. - Wild Island region \u2018Stone Village\u2019 has a chance to remove the POI from the map, even after discovering it.\n\n32. - Empty stashes appear on the map after you have looted them before getting the location from a PDA.\n\n33. - Guns spawn in your inventory and replace your secondary gun slot.\n\n34. - Dying then reloading can Disable Horizontal controls, movement, ducking, and sprinting, leaving the player hard-locked. This glitch persists across all save files, old and new. To fix: Exit the game completely.\n\n35. - Reloading a save after a creature dies on top of the player can break the ability to run. Players will be forced to walk everywhere! Must restart the game to fix this glitch.\n\n36. - Revive Canadian at 'Bridge to LYMANSKI'!!! (Just kidding on that last one :P) Long Live Canadia eh!\n\nThere are hundreds more, but these are the main ones I personally think should be fixed.\n\nI prefer to be as in-depth as possible. So, to conclude, with the amount of bugs and glitches in the game, I truly feel like I paid to be a beta tester.\n\nI was truly looking forward to playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl and I truly worry for the future of the gaming industry if a game can release in such a horrible state and be praised by fans, top online personalities, and game journalists alike. Truly a great game, but it doesn't deserve a positive review, at least not from me.", "hours": 7641, "hoursAtReview": 7641, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733595245}, {"text": "The new Stalker turned out to be not quite what was expected. Which is quite logical, in 14 years any game would be very different from the previous one. Therefore, the developers had to try hard not to make it a failure. A similar situation with Half-Life 3. If the continuation of the HL series came out after 14 years, it would either be a failure or Valve would have to come up with something absolutely grandiose, ideal, preserving everything as before. That's why it was not released and it is unlikely that this will ever happen. But specifically with Stalker 2, the situation is different. GSC Game World made a dystopian game in 14 or 6 years. They did not try, they made an average game, which at the start did not work properly, thereby throwing shit into the ventilator for Russian haters. Personally, I, like many others, obviously expected much more from this project, in 14 years. It seems that the developers from GSC really dislike their fans, releasing such a game. The developers' hostility towards the player is felt in the first minutes of a serious fight in Stalker 2. Enemies hear you and shoot through walls with amazing accuracy, when you can't kill an enemy without armor with your AKS-74 or MP4, emptying the entire clip. It feels like you're playing with players using evil Rage Cheats in CS 2. This is also indirectly confirmed by the fact that for so long they worked on the game they didn't do any optimization, people like me simply can't play at 10 fps. Unfavorable unrealistic economy in the game. Some tips on the loading screen are repeated under the same number, they sound ridiculous because the game simply doesn't have the mechanics described in these tips. And there are still many bloopers, bugs, lags, etc. Perhaps they just hyped up good reviews about their product and didn't even apologize for all of the above, and they are in no hurry to release patches. Although the reviews can be quite real, if they are written by some fools or just loyal fans, I will not claim anything, but nevertheless I am not the only one who wrote about serious problems of the game that they do not pay attention to. In general, the developers of this studio have already ruined their reputation by making the game for 14 years and with the release of Stalker 2 they completely ruined my attitude towards them.\nStalker 2 looks much worse than its competitors, Metro Exodus or Cyberpunk in terms of gameplay, optimization and graphics. And this is despite the fact that the listed games were released much earlier and Stalker was developed, let me remind you, for a very long time. I have not yet met a single game where the optimization was so bad on release that it was completely impossible to play.\n\nMore about the game:\nAfter watching the gameplay trailers, it seemed to me that the game would be similar to Call of Duty in the style of modern shooters on UE. But my expectations were not met and this is good because then it would have completely killed the atmosphere of the first Stalker. What the developers really deserve to be praised for is that even after so many years and the transition to a new engine, some of the atmosphere of the first games has been preserved. They were able to repeat the same \"rough\" textures similar to those in the first games, which brings back that very atmosphere. But since this is UE5, this is not enough. This deficiency is immediately visible, for example, by the rounded geometry of buildings, etc. The first Stalkers had their own engine that did all this, any other, of course, will not repeat everything as much as it was before.\nAlthough the graphics are inferior to other games, at the same time it is pleasing that now there is Stalker with high resolution textures similar to those that were before.\nOtherwise, there are only disadvantages ...\nThere is no longer such a feeling that you are exploring abandoned places of the Soviet Union, zones in general as consequences of those times ...\nI think this is also connected with the transition to UE.\nThey removed some mechanics from the first games. For example, displaying the name of the group when looting a corpse. Some associations, names, behavior of NPCs and groups have changed a lot, new ones have appeared. Which negatively affects the immersion in the game, if this is considered not as a new game, but as a continuation of the old ones.\nThey removed the atmospheric ambient music that played in the background in the first parts of Stalker, or at least they could not make the same new one.\nPoor lighting, many darkened graphic objects, and the change of day and night works too quickly. During sleep, it is impossible to control what time of day to wake up.\nEach time the game is loaded, shaders are compiled.\nThere is almost no benefit in looting corpses, they always have broken weapons, no ammo, no variability. Returning to the question of the economy in the game.\nChanging weapons takes quite a long time, there is no automatic reloading with the default game settings.\nEveryone speaks Ukrainian, and the translation in the subtitles is not entirely accurate. Which is unrealistic because in Ukraine many people also use Russian. I can't say anything about the plot because I haven't completed the game yet.\nIf you take everything listed at the beginning of the review and add cheating enemies, the mortality of the main character, bad economy, optimization, and the fact that the graphics and gameplay are inferior to competitors for so many years of waiting for this game, draw your own conclusions..\n\nNow more about optimization:\nThis is just awful. After a while, the fps drops to 10-15. And when the fps stays around 50, stutters appear. The first two hours of playing were still bearable, but then the fps drops began to occur more often and it became unplayable.\nWith a decrease in texture quality, the inclusion of frame generation parameters and dlls, the game begins to work at 100 fps a little more stably, but frames still drop to 20 fps quite often.\nAlso, with normal fps, stutters still occur, input lag, and at some point the game just crashes. To fix a crash or fps drops, only a computer reboot helps.\nThe system requirements stated by the developers say that with my video card the game should run at 60 fps on maximum graphics settings. I wonder how they tested it so that they didn't notice how the fps dropped to an unplayable state in this configuration.\nOnce again, don't believe 80% of the enthusiastic reviews from idiots on Steam who bought the game and play at 40 fps on RTX 4090 or at 15 fps on other cards and are happy about it...\n\n\nMy PC:\nIntel i9 10900K\nRTX 3070 Ti Palit GameRock\nCorsair Vengeance RGB PRO 32GB 4000Mhz\nNoctua NH-D15\nSamsung 980 PRO", "hours": 5581, "hoursAtReview": 3534, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732193931}, {"text": "Is the game fun?

If you turn frame generation on, it gets way worse. [Some mods try to make it better and the game was unplayable without them in my experience.]\n\n[b]Low FPS/FPS drops:[/b] The performance is actually just terrible. It gets way worse in settlements. [Some mods try to fix that, helping in some cases, but they just didn't work for me. I'm currently playing the game with 13~25 FPS on a 3060 Ti without frame generation to avoid the input lag.]\n\n[strike][b]Mouse input:[/b] The devs for some reason decided to make mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration enabled by default, with no option to change it other than in the .ini files/modding the game to disable them, which makes the game horrible to play in my experience and even worse because of the input lag/high latency problems. [Again, there are mods to disable mouse smoothing/acceleration.][/strike]\nEdit: Devs listened to the feedback and disabled mouse acceleration/mouse smoothing by default in the new 1.0.3 patch.\n\n[b]Ledge grabbing height:[/b] You cannot vault/ledge grab in a height that you'd expect you would, and I think that is an oversight from the devs because there are stashes in places that you cannot get to without jumping inside through the roof of the house/building. [There is a mod that changes the ledge grabbing height, making the game way less frustrating]\n\n[b]AI/A-Life 2.0 is horrible:[/b] The AI spawns really close to you, sometimes respawning on top of enemies you just killed, or spawning behind your back somewhere you just passed. They don't seem to do stuff around the map like previous games, they just spawn really close to you so you can see them there and then go in a random direction or try to attack you. The AI also does not seem to react as much as the ones in the previous games, for example after killing enemies they not loot them anymore, they just walk away, and they also don't seem to care if you loot their dead friends. The AI constantly spams grenades making combat very frustrating, and sometimes just decide to turn their back on you in the middle of a gunfight for no reason at all. [Some mods try to band-aid these problems, but they're mostly stuff we'll need to wait for the devs to fix themselves.]\n\nThe devs for some reason made the decision to make the shaders be compiled every single time you open the game, which is not really necessary and might be an oversight, and it can take up to 10 minutes. [There is a mod that disables it, but you should know what you're doing if you intend on using it.]\n\n[h3]BALANCING PROBLEMS[/h3]\n\n[b]Bullet Sponge Mutants:[/b] Mutants (especially Bloodsuckers in my experience) are bullet sponges, tanking multiple magazines, which is even bigger of a problem in the early game considering you won't have much ammo. [There is a very good mod that balances mutants HP, resistances and damage.]\n\n[b]Weapon durability/repair cost:[/b] Weapons lose durability way too fast and are way too expensive to fix (apparently the devs tried to balance that better in the new patch, but I haven't tried it yet). [There are mods to make the durability go down slower and mods that make repair/upgrade costs cheaper too.]\n\nMissions would pay too little, but they seem to have tried to balance that better in the new patch (again, haven't tried it yet).\n\nAlso it's good to mention that at least until now there is no New Game Plus feature, and multiplayer was also not released yet.\n\n[h3]So, should you buy the game?[/h3]\n\nIf you're interested in it, have a decent computer, is willing to deal with all of these problems and feel like modding the game for a few hours, [b]yes[/b], the game is very fun to play and after the devs finally fix these problems and add new content it'll be an even better experience.\n\nIf you don't feel like dealing with these problems, don't buy it for now and wait a while for the game to be fixed first.\n\n\nI might update this review once in a while.", "hours": 1985, "hoursAtReview": 1985, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732998904}, {"text": "Stalker 2's Missed Opportunities: A Critical Look at Visual Clarity, Accessibility, and A-Life\n\nThe long-awaited release of Stalker 2, powered by Unreal Engine 5, has sparked excitement across the gaming community. However, for all its technical advancements and graphical ambitions, the game falls short in critical areas that are integral to the Stalker experience. From its over-reliance on upscalers to issues with accessibility and the apparent absence of a fully-functional \"A-Life\" system, Stalker 2 feels like a visually stunning, but thematically disjointed, entry in the series.\n\n1. Over-Reliance on Upscalers: A Threat to Visual Clarity\n\nWhile upscaling technologies like DLSS and FSR have become popular tools for maintaining performance in graphically demanding games, Stalker 2 relies on them to the detriment of visual clarity. Beyond 20 meters, environments lack the sharpness and fidelity that fans of the series expect. The dense, immersive world of the Zone\u2014once alive with intricate details and subtle cues\u2014is now smoothed over by aggressive upscaling artifacts, making distant objects appear muddy or poorly defined.\n\nFor a game that thrives on exploration and environmental storytelling, this is a significant misstep. Players rely on visual detail to navigate the Zone and identify threats, and the current implementation hinders their ability to fully engage with the game world.\n\n2. Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing: A Barrier to Accessibility\n\nThe anti-aliasing techniques employed in Stalker 2 introduce pervasive motion blur, especially during fast-paced sequences or even simple camera movements. While AA is essential for reducing jagged edges, its implementation here creates a visual effect that can be headache-inducing and disorienting for many players. For a game that demands quick reflexes and spatial awareness, this is more than a minor inconvenience\u2014it becomes an accessibility issue.\n\nDevelopers should prioritize options that allow players to adjust or disable such effects, ensuring a wider audience can enjoy the game without discomfort. The lack of these features at launch is a glaring oversight.\n\n3. The Absence of Functional A-Life: A Core Element Missing\n\nOne of the hallmarks of the Stalker series is its \"A-Life\" system, a groundbreaking AI simulation that brings the Zone to life. A-Life populates the world with dynamic, unscripted encounters, creating a sense of unpredictability and realism that few games can replicate. In Stalker 2, however, this system appears to be severely compromised\u2014or missing altogether.\n\nThis becomes particularly evident when players reload quicksaves. Hotspots generate entirely new encounters with each reload, revealing a system that relies on static spawning rather than a persistent simulation. This not only breaks immersion but also undermines the very essence of what makes Stalker unique. A-Life isn\u2019t just a feature; it\u2019s the soul of the series. Its absence feels like a betrayal to long-time fans who expected the next evolution of this iconic mechanic.\n\n4. A Call for Better Optimization and Design Choices\n\nWhile technical challenges are understandable in modern game development, the issues present in Stalker 2 are indicative of misplaced priorities. Instead of relying so heavily on upscalers, developers should focus on optimizing native rendering for clearer visuals. Accessibility features such as customizable motion blur and AA settings should be non-negotiable in a game with such a vast and diverse audience. Most importantly, A-Life must return in its full glory to preserve the authenticity of the Stalker experience.\n\nConclusion\n\nStalker 2 is an ambitious title, but ambition alone cannot compensate for shortcomings in execution. By addressing these issues\u2014enhancing visual clarity, improving accessibility, and reinstating a functional A-Life system\u2014developers can transform Stalker 2 into the masterpiece it has the potential to be.

It feels like a half baked game where enemies only spawn 50 feet infront of you. And half of the features are missing.\n\nFor example, you\u2019re in top of a guard tower and you look down to see a gate entrance with no one there. But if you walk down to the gate entrance, walk forward and then look back, the enemies guards now spawn. It honestly feels like I\u2019m playing Garry\u2019s mod with people spawning enemy NPCs infront of you over and over.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why there are no sniper scopes OR binoculars in the game even though we can see NPCs use them. It\u2019s because there\u2019s nothing to look at. Not a single enemy will spawn farther than 50 feet away from you. \n\nAlso for a game that always takes place at night, there\u2019s no such thing as night vision.. what a joke.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more issues such as low damage to mutants, buggy weapons, and piss poor performance, but the worst thing is the \u201cimplementation\u201d of A-life 2.0. The game is empty because of this. The Devs said they will fix it in time, but it is a core feature present in all of the stalker games.\n\nI never review games on steam, but i was looking forward for stalker 2 since it was first announced.

Of course, I\u2019ve played Lost Alpha, who hasn\u2019t? It\u2019s basically mandatory for Stalker fans. And Misery? it\u2019s not just a mod.. it\u2019s a survival simulator that makes you masochist. Anomaly? Yeah, it doesn\u2019t just merge the trilogy, it crams in so much extra content that even the Zone itself might say, \u201cOkay buddy thats enough!\u201d Believe me, I\u2019ve been there. But nothing can compare to that magical moment in 2007 when I first installed the first Stalker game and heard that haunting main menu music. At the same time, I was also playing Condemned Criminal Origins and had developed this weird obsession with dark, heavy games that most sane people wouldn\u2019t touch. (Thanks to Clive Barker's Undying, F.E.A.R., Call Of Cthulhu, Deus Ex, Silent Hill 2 and Manhunt for fueling my love for dark games)\r\nHonestly, I\u2019ve never seen a Stalker game with good optimization in human history... and yes, Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl proudly carries on this sacred tradition. Whatever you do, don\u2019t even think about starting the game without DLSS turned on.\r\nGiven the war situation, I was almost certain the game would feel incomplete. But so far, I haven\u2019t come across any serious bugs or crashes. Come on, the game only crashed twice in 9 hours that's a solid ratio! By Stalker standards, that's practically a blessing. Old fans might initially feel that Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl is less like a next-gen Stalker and more like Metro on steroids.. don\u2019t panic, it\u2019s not you. When your gun jams, your stomach growls, or you stumble upon those cursed Bloodsuckers, all sense of hope and joy just evaporates. It\u2019s like the Zone itself whispers, \u201cBoi this is not Metro, welcome to misery.\u201d\r\nAnother curious thing is, not offering a pre-load for a game that's over 150 gigs? That's pure chaos. It's like asking someone to fill a swimming pool with a teaspoon and then wondering why it\u2019s taking so long.\r\nIn short, Stalker 2 looks way better than I expected (if you ignore the optimization that\u2019s held together by duct tape and prayers) I can already see myself pouring at least 100 hours into this radioactive masterpiece, kissing 2024 goodbye in the Zone, and enduring at least 23 crashes along the way.\r\n\r\nGood hunting, Stalker.", "hours": 5037, "hoursAtReview": 596, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732182843}, {"text": "[h1] An under-cooked game with the infrastructure to be great [/h1]\n\n[b] I will start with some pros and then dive into the cons, which are numerous. [/b]\n\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n\n[list]\n    [*]Beautifully crafted, seamless open world that gives the biggest and best open world games to date a run for their money. Well made weather effects that successfully impact the environment and your perception of it.\n    [*]Satisfying gun-play with well made animations, solid sounds, and a general feeling of satisfaction when blowing away your enemies. A decent amount of weaponry to choose from as well.\n    [*]An improvement in storytelling immersion with Bethesda/Bioware style NPC conversations vs. the typical text box style of NPC communication from previous games.\n    [*]A continuation of GSCs attention to detail with items: tons of ammo types, food, drink, meds, armors and artifacts to fill your stash with.\n    [*]An engaging story line 12 hours in, with well crafted cut scene sequences that breathe life into characters.\n    [*]Re-imagined and modernized mutant types with new and challenging abilities that would be a blast to fight if not for some horrible balancing issues (see cons).\n[/list]\n\nAnd so the list of pros runs rather short, although what we have is a game that can reach its full potential once the following cons are addressed by devs and/or modders (many of the cons below have already been addressed by the incredibly active modding community).\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]My specs for reference: 7800X3D processor, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 4070 Ti 16GB. I am running the game on all EPIC at 2K with DLSS and frame generation. The optimization in the game is subpar. Memory leaks that slow the game to a crawl and require a restart, tanking of frames in NPC hubs, HUD glitches which require reload, and occasional CTDs on startup are the four specific issues I have experienced myself when it comes to optimization and performance.\n    [*]Texture flickering is egregious. Textures on many building walls will flicker, in some areas so noticeably and on so many textures that it breaks immersion.\n    [*]The lighting is bad, specifically the eye adjustment feature in the game. The game often renders indoor environment dark as night during the middle of the day and absolutely pitch black at night even with the use of the flashlight. You will need a flashlight to see clearly indoors during the day.\n    [*]Speaking of the flashlight, it seems to have time traveled from its invention date of 1899 and absolutely pales in comparison to what the flashlight from previous STALKER installments were capable of illuminating. With a dim yellowish tint and about a 5 meter distance the flashlight is a disappointing tool in the Stalker's arsenal and proves ineffective in almost all circumstances outside of illuminating indoor environment during the day. Player flashlight also casts no shadows.\n    [*]The day night cycle is far too rapid with the light part of a day seemingly just a half hour of game time in length. This breaks immersion and serves no benefit to the game play loop (mods have addressed this).\n    [*]You can sleep but you cant choose for how long. The intention with sleeping is typically to skip a dark period such as night, but when you have to sleep twice to do so, and inadvertently waste some precious daylight it is a frustrating experience.\n    [*]The loot in the game is completely unbalanced. Food is ridiculously abundant, to the point where you can have stacks of 100s of food items in your stash early on. This breaks some immersion and works against any sort of satisfaction in the game play loop for finding survival items. The same goes for meds which are so abundant you will be sitting on 500 bandages and a 100+ medkits shortly after the opening zone or two. On the other hand, finding ammo on slain opponents is far too rare. In previous STALKERs you would typically find about a magazine's worth of ammo on an enemy; in this game just 2-6 rounds (sometimes a single round). All in all, looting feels unbalanced and unsatisfying.\n    [*]The quest economy coupled with the cost of repairs is so laughable you will wonder if GSC had even managed a single play test of their game before release. Quests offer such minuscule monetary rewards that in almost all instances you will be spending more in ammo and repair costs to complete a quest than you will be rewarded. Repairs cost so much its shocking, often times resulting in armor repairs from moderate damage (70-80% quality) costing more than all the quest rewards combined for the opening zone (mods have addressed this).\n    [*]Mutant balancing is abysmal. On Stalker difficulty it will take 2-3 complete magazine unloads to down a single bloodsucker who cannot be flinched or delayed in his rapid advance towards you. Coupled with a stun lock you receive from his initial strike this results in frustrating encounters that feel unrewarding and unnecessarily punishing. Not to mention, the rate at which bloodsuckers are encountered, often in closely packed groups of 3-4, take any and all novelty out of fighting the fearsome creatures. Every bloodsucker fight ends up in a wild sprint and dodge fest while attempting to unload your ammunition into him as quickly as possible as he strikes you for 50-80% damage. This is just one mutant, but they are ALL bullet sponges at about 4x what they were in previous games. The Psydog is ridiculous as well but I won't dive into details. (mods have addressed some of this).\n    [*]Cover for emissions seems inconsistent as many enclosed structures provide no cover, while others do. There are zones where no cover is available at all.\n    [*]A lack of any statistics or details when it comes to factions and reputation, along with no easy way to identify NPC factions. A feature in all three previous games is obfuscated and lacks data for the player in this game. No Stalker rankings and so many steps backwards from information which was accessible through the PDA in previous games.\n    [*]Laser beam enemies who will not miss which really hurts the feeling of chaos and realism in combat situations. Enemies can see through foliage and in pitch black situations with ease.\n    [*]Speaking of enemies seeing you with ease, there is no element of stealth in this game. Forget about sneaking the game is simply not built to support that feature at the moment.\n    [*] No night vision in suits or as an upgrade for head wear. Truly baffling in a game which consists of half dark nights and tunnels/caves. A feature in all previous STALKER games.\n    [*] English voice acting is 1/3rd eastern euro, 1/3rd cockney brits, 1/3rd midwesterner, an odd choice\n    [*]Now the biggest issue: the spawning controller in this game is an absolute mess. From speaking to modders it seems that any attempt at spawning enemies in the world to patrol and NPC scheduling (A LIFE as its known) is simply not in the game. You will never encounter an enemy further than 100m (most of the time within 50m or less), and often times will see enemies spawn right in front of you, if they don't spawn right behind you. This is by far the most frustrating part of the game and explains the omission of binoculars (it also renders sniper rifles useless). Coupled with the lack of stealth you will often see the indicator for the enemy spotting you briefly appear when walking around indicating that an enemy has spawned nearby and you will soon be in CQB. Enemies seem to only spawn in zones of interest, everything in between is dead.\n[/list]\n\nSTALKER 2 is a beta/early access release, make no mistake. Performance and balancing issues point to a severe rush on GSC's end. There are numerous enough issues where I've decided to put the game down for now, while waiting for the devs and modders to work their magic.

After a long, grueling day at work, there\u2019s nothing better than jumping into the fray with your colleague by your side. The rush of storming objectives, laying down suppressive fire, or barely surviving a tank assault together creates a bond like no other. It\u2019s the kind of fun that makes you forget the grind of the day and lose yourself in the madness of war.\n\nBut then, the cheaters show up. Nothing kills the vibe faster than lining up the perfect shot, only to be insta-killed by someone snapping their aim halfway across the map with inhuman precision. You look at the killcam, and there they are, spinning like a broken lawn sprinkler, headshotting everyone in sight. Rage boils over. You scream at the screen. Where\u2019s the anti-cheat system? How does a game this beautiful, this immersive, get tarnished by such blatant hacks? It\u2019s maddening.\n\nYet somehow, Battlefield V keeps pulling you back in.

You\u2019ll rage together when a cheater wipes your squad, but then you\u2019ll crack up after respawning and accidentally crashing your plane straight into each other. The game shines in those moments of shared chaos, where teamwork and laughter triumph over frustration.\n\nThe class system makes every match feel like a collaborative effort. One of you drops medkits while the other lays down ammo, and suddenly you\u2019re an unstoppable team. Every kill feels earned, every revive feels like a small victory, and every explosion reminds you why you keep coming back. Sure, cheaters are a plague, but they can\u2019t take away the camaraderie and pure joy of tearing through the battlefield with a friend.\n\nBattlefield V is far from perfect, but when you\u2019re dodging bullets and cracking jokes with your colleague after a hard day, the flaws fade into the background.

Pair that with their anti-cheat, and you\u2019ve got the perfect recipe for regret.\n\nWhy I Refunded It\nI refunded the game right after I got sniped by a guy swimming through a wall, moments before my tank spontaneously exploded because it hit an invisible pebble. Honestly, it felt like the game was trying to refund me.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nBattlefield V has its moments of brilliance buried under mountains of bugs, bad optimization, and EA\u2019s overreach with their software. If frustration and anti-cheat drivers installing themselves uninvited sound like your thing, this might just be the game for you. Otherwise, I\u2019d recommend saving your sanity and maybe playing Free Fire instead.\n\nThanks, EA, for the unforgettable experience. \ud83d\udca9", "hours": 141, "hoursAtReview": 141, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1734129449}, {"text": "unfortunately 0 autobalance in the game so atleast 90% of the games one of the team i just losing big time and everyone is leaving.

Rather than have a more typical design for 1st/3rd person shooters where the enemies die in one or a few hits, depending on the weapon and enemy type, the enemies take damage based on your level relative to the mission level. This means that most of the time, unless you grind ahead, the enemies will be bullet sponges. Even when you snipe an enemy in the head undetected, it won't kill them instantly. I get that this is deliberate, but it sucks. It's not an enjoyable or satisfying way to play a shooter game. The cover-to-cover system is also flawed, and enemies may be able to hit you but you can't hit them, or shoot through a fence that just blocks your shots.\n\nThe main missions are pretty cool and fun at times but the side missions are re-used and repetitive. \"Go here and kill everyone\", \"Carry these items that slow you down from A to B while enemies spawn on you\", etc. The spawning isn't good either. There's no dynamic detection of where you're standing, so enemies often spawn in droves from a door right behind you or drop down on top of you.\n\nThere's no stealth system even though it feels like there should be. You can avoid detection from enemies but if you kill one, it just alerts everyone else.\n\nThe looting is OK. You at least get good stuff pretty consistently, but the \"quality\" the game gives you can be misleading because some of the bonuses a gun has can ultimately be ignored if the other has more damage or a bigger magazine. The crafting is completely unnecessary since you can loot what you need and the weapons are all worse than the stuff you loot at the same level.\n\nThe atmosphere is very nice at times, as is the setting itself, but all the characters are ugly and mostly uninteresting. The people you encounter don't look like the last people that would be alive during a pandemic, but the first people to die. I understand the idea that they want to show \"regular people\" in harsh conditions, but it's like they're afraid to make anyone look even average. On a related note, the customization is abysmal. You have very limited choices in how your character looks and the clothing is all generic junk, so you'll need to spend real money for more cases. Even then, most of the stuff you get doesn't look cool.\n\nBut, again, the game design is the major problem.

Multiplayer is relegated to the Quests, which are optional missions that you can do to get loot and EXP, and tie into the post-game. While extensive and very fun on their own, it doesn't scratch the same itch as playing through the campaign with a friend or two.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the story, as the plot is a stand-alone story that takes place after the main story for the original mobile game. On one hand, it does make an attempt at onboarding new players, but at the start, you're just thrown into the crew with already established relationships, and have to rely on Fate Episodes to get to know them. These are visual novel style segments that give a brief summary of each character's backstory and how they joined the crew. It does a decent enough job that it got me curious to try the anime, which I recommend watching before playing Relink, since it's an adaptation of the original main story.\n\nAs for Relink's plot, it's pretty short and sweet, just stardard JRPG fare, but it's honestly kind of a vibe. It's very clich\u00e9 in a comfortable, familiar way, and doesn't require any previous Granblue knowledge to understand beyond what the game gives you.\n\nThe art and graphics look great. It only gets a bit boring on the environment design, but the characters in particular translate really well from the art to the 3D models. It runs smooth at max graphics on my 3060 as well, which is always a plus for a good-looking game.\n\nThe combat was the main draw for me. It's an ARPG where dodging and blocking are your main defensive tools, as well as character-specific defensive skills, and then you can just wail on the enemies with flashy combos and abilities.\n\nWhat kept me engaged was the fact that bosses are capable of handling four characters fighting them at the same time. They have hefty HP bars and lots of AoE and multi-target attacks that you have to at least consider instead of just spamming your stuff with no retaliation. It's no Elden Ring in terms of difficulty, you won't see the Game Over screen often at all, but the bosses are respectably challenging.\n\nTL;DR: Get this game if you like ARPGs, or if you're like me and love JRPGs but dislike turn-based combat.

It almost feels like you're playing a Studio Ghibli game at times! The combat is also pretty fleshed out and has a lot of depth, but with unfortunately some major caveats.\n\n[h2]The bad[/h2]\nThe TL;DR is that the biggest problem with this game is how BORING the beginning of the game can be. \n\nThe story is pretty unoriginal and is something we've all seen a million times before. Mild spoilers, but the story can be summed up as follows:\n[i]\"You find a mysterious person and that person becomes your friend. It turns out that friend is actually secretly powerful, and the baddies want to use your powerful friend for their own nefarious means.\"[/i]\nAgain, not the most compelling nor original story. Character development is also pretty weak, and I wished more was shown about how the crew came together.\n\nThe next problem is the level design, which is quite frankly, [b]awful[/b]. Zones are linear, but they can be unnecessarily MASSIVE, to the point where picking up items and looting chests feels like an incredible chore. After 8 hours of gameplay, I thought zones were pretty bad, that is until I got to a certain desert zone that was just painfully expansive with chests scattered at each corner. Sorry, but I'm done holding down the analog stick to run across unnecessarily large swathes of land.\n\nAnd lastly, progression is just too. damn. slow. The only reason I know about the depth of the combat is because I watched YouTube videos on it. In terms of the main story progression, you're stuck with playing the same character until you complete the story. Sadly, the main character is a pretty boring character to play. 8 hours in, and it feels like my character has picked up zero unique skills to make the experience more fun. It's just the same combos and attack rotation over and over again.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nI don't really want to give Relink a negative review because I do think it's a good game, but it clearly isn't for everyone. Diehard JRPG fans should adore this game, but unless you're willing to put up with the drag of the early game, this probably isn't for you.

The boss fights are all incredible, especially the last few post game fights. To make things even better, all the non-story quest are playable with friends.

And it takes too long to find players. Most game modes are dead.\n[*]No bots (computer players), so you have to play with random people if you don't have friends.\n[*]Too expensive (49.97 US dollars for the game and both map packs) for a game from 2009 that is full of hackers and cheaters. If Activision doesn't support old CoD games anymore, then it should make them completely free-to-play (and it should include all the downloadable content for free).\n[*]The CoD community is awful. Cheaters and hackers ruin games.\n[*]Unrealistic weapons and equipment. Older CoD games have a little bit more realistic weapons and equipment.\n[*]Despite being rated \"Mature\" (17+) by the ESRB, many titles and emblems in the game don't look serious at all along with the Carnival map which takes place in a theme park.\n[*]You can't lean.\n[*]Cut content.\n[*]No content from previous games.\n[*]The Favela map is still missing from the map rotation in public lobbies of IWNet. It's only available in private lobbies. The Rust map is actually available in public lobbies, but it takes time to find.\n[*]Activision uses legal demands to remove mods, but not cheats and hacks for this game (search engines still show them).\n[*]Valve censors the name \"I W 4 X\" (an old mod for this game, even though this name can be a part of a website link or a device name), but still allows this very dangerous game to be sold on Steam. Another evidence that freedom, consumer protection, work ethic, and competence don't exist in the West anymore. The industry should just admit that it doesn't care about customers at all.\nAn example: https://steamcommunity.com/discussions/forum/1/2149847423923234702/\n[*]No official release notes. I can't find them anywhere.\n[*]Not vegan friendly.\n[*]I can't post a review for the singleplayer mode. It says \"There was a problem posting your review.\" without even mentioning what exactly causes this problem. As always, Valve manages Steam in a terrible way and ignores complaints.\n[/list]\nActivision and IW should have spent more time and money on game development, text translators, customer support, and quality control instead of on \"Easter eggs\", licensed music (heard during the first mission), advertisement, and celebrities.

Rather than reverting to the previous voice chat backend (Phonon), the developers just ignored the problem, leaving the game in an essentially broken state for many players for months now. Even critical issues like this remain unaddressed when the fix would be as easy as just reverting a change. Also, many old bugs were never addressed, making this game feel like it falls more and more into disrepair with every update\n\n* Performance - falls into a similar category of the game accumulating more and more technical debt. Where you could easily run the 2020 version of the game on a low-end machine back then, these days you'll get occasional massive lags even on a mid- to high-end machine.\n\n* Lack of content - In the past (2020/2021) this game used to have an open beta where you could try out new or changed content. Updates on that branch would range from once a week to multiple times a day. While most of the updates were of course minor changes and fixes, you basically got a game mechanics improvement, changed ghost mechanics etc pretty much every other week. They listend to feedback to finetune these changes before pushing them to the release build every few months. Mid-2021 they stopped doing this open kind of development and in turn promised to release regular big updates as a kind of big content/mechanics drops and when the 0.3 update arrived a while after, it was a massive success. It overhauled lots of equipment, their effects, how they interact with ghost hunts, introduced a new evidence, changed the existing ghost evidences around, introduced new ghosts - overall just great. The next update 0.4 came not that long after and was the 2021 halloween update and was just as great, adding a new map, having some doors start open (so that coming across an open door no longer means ghost room) allowing ghosts to change rooms and adding a new difficulty, After that however, new content pretty much stalled. 0.5 would add cursed posessions which are fine, but for the most part just gimmicky things. 0.6 was just a VR overhaul which - in typical Phasmophobia fashion - broke VR completely for a good bunch of VR players - the issues remain unaddressed to this day.\nNow we're starting to get to the point where the game went into a very poor direction. Many people at the time were already complaining about the lack of meaningful content for the majority of people - especially with the long awaited \"Horror 2.0\" being delayed again and again (it's still not out by this day), so the developers promised a complete makeover of the Asylum map (which was the by far largest map at the time, but many rooms looked very similar). This then came in the 0.7 update in form of the Sunny Meadows map which shares nothing with the original Asylum map (other than both being an insane asylum), performs much worse and doesn't play very well with the game's mechanics. Many rooms still feel pretty much the same (even though usually more detailed). The tone also feels very off compared to the rest of the game. The rest of the locations may be creepy (such as the abandoned high school or prison), but were always just that and nothing more, never the big evil place where so many spooky things are happening. On Sunny Meadows you have screams in the hallways, rooms with the floor just covered in blood and human remains, rooms where the floor is covered with removed jaws, etc. They also removed the original Asylum map with that patch, preventing the players who liked it to play that map any longer. To the developer's credit: The 0.7 update also brought the 2021 halloween event which was the first and also most fun event they ever did. You had to play on nightmare mode on a few maps, collect all hidden candy which would then spawn pumpkins which you all had to light which would then cause the ghost to wear a pumpkin hat which you had to photograph. Do all of that and identify the ghost. Not too hard, but fun. The patch didn't introduce new game mechanics, it just took away a beloved map and replaced it with one that doesn't play well.\nNext was the \"player progression\" update which was the worst design decision made regarding this game. Rather than leveling up endlessly as previously, they reset everyone's level to 1 and once you reach level 100 you can press a button to reset your level back to 1, losing all unlocks in the process. I don't know how they ever thought that this would even remotely be a good idea. To the developer's credit: They announced these plans about a year in advance. Everyone hated it. They went through with it regardless and ignored all player feedback - everyone still hated it. No new actual game mechanics again. Even after these lackluster updates, there was no new \"major\" update until nearly a year later which only added a new lighthouse map which - surprise - doesn't play very well.\nWhich brings us to the 0.11 update which replaced the task-based seasonal events with community events where it's just \"photograph/use these randomly spawned things and/or complete the mission to contribute to a big score pool\", nothing else.\nIf you paid attention, you may have noticed that not much has changed for the positive since the addition of the cursed posessions about three years ago. The game has gotten stagnant. The developers have gotten too comfortable on the hype that was around it to the point that games which started out as just Phasmophobia clones like Ghost Exile these days offer a much more engaging and in-depth gameplay than Phasmophobia does and have surpassed their master \n\n* Ignoring the players\nNow this is highly subjective, but they used parts of the money and ressources they gained through Steam's early access program to port this game to consoles rather than using the ressources to overhaul things, add new mechanics, fix bugs, etc in the actual game to bring it closer to release. Nobody would have cared if this were already a fully released title, but with an early access title, there's the expectation that the money earned is used to actually finish the game rather than to swim on the hype train and also milk console players for their money. This gets even worse as the developers have completely stopped publishing changelogs for their patches through Steam (even though it would just be a copy-paste action for them), so if you want to see changelogs, you now have to go to their website. Their reason being that they just want one place for all players to view changelogs. Why they can't copypaste these into Steam like every other dev out there does is beyond me.\n", "hours": 45691, "hoursAtReview": 45691, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1734024089}, {"text": "Phasmophobia is way too scary for me.

Bring a couple of buddies to share the spooks and to make it a bit more Scooby-Doo-esque.

Though to be frank, me and my pardner in crime did skip the tutorial (which I do recommend you partake in). After a dozen hours you slowly start to grasp how everything works and what some of the ghosts' different quirks are. Depending on the amount of mystique you want to maintain, the wiki can lift the veil a bit on some mechanics, potentially improving your efficiency and survival rate markedly.\n\nAfter forty hours it feels like I've gained a bit of a grasp on ghost huntin' and have seen the majority of what Phasmophobia has to offer.

Before I go into the negatives, I like the art direction of most of the maps and combat still feels very good. I also enjoyed the final boss fight and it is probably my new favorite fight compared to all the games I played. The bosses are engaging and fun to learn their move sets. The game would be a great linear shoot-em-up game if it didn't have issues, but sadly it has many.\n\nThis game shows itself as a action packed RPG with loads of customization content, which is inherently true, trying to get to said content is an absolute sht show and I'm being nice. They should remove the adventure tag for this game and replace it with \"search simulator\", because to obtain every one item you have to do a 18 step search quests that is based on luck and RNG to obtain. The puzzles in this game are either two things: extremely dumbed down so a two year old could do it (there is a puzzle where you play tik tac toe with a stone statue to open doors), or there are puzzles that are so overly complicated that the reward is NEVER worth it. I will admit, I liked the statue one way more than the rest, and its because I didn't have to spend three hours trying to figure it out or one hour spent on the wiki. Some of these puzzles hold necessary progression points or hold a item that is almost a must to progress so good luck trying to avoid them. You're lucky if they just give you a puzzle, because 80% of the items in this game are so well hidden that it would take you literal years to find them. I'm not against hiding items in your game, but when I am 30 hours in and still using the starting weapons, OR the fact that someone had to data mine the game just to find a new weapon class, I think we need to change some things. I hope a cheat engine that spawns items and runs scripts to gain weapon classes gets made for this game.\n\nSPOILER in this paragraph\nI never liked the stories of most soul-like games. They are usually crap, just no one says it. But this one just confuses the hll out of me and especially the ending. Now, I'm not a astrophysicist, nor do I have any magical powers of my own, but the girl that you are trying to track down in the story, at the very end, they talk about resetting the universe because the boss keeps regenerating itself. Based on what little I know about power consumption, wouldn't it be more feasible for the girl to just make the boss not regenerate instead of resetting the whole universe? I know the universe is small and all but still.\n\nOverall, this is not a adventure game, this is a search and rage simulator game that locks all the content that you paid for behind data mining, over complicated puzzles, and weeks of your time. I dare anyone who is new to the game to spend ten hours (without wiki) and find 5 non purchasable guns. The only thing that is fun about this game is the combat but it's still annoying to be running the same build for the last couple days. This game will make you rage and rage even more when you realize you spent 3 hours for a necklace that increases your defense by 5.

It is designed to be addictive, and to get as much money out of you as possible. Scripting, implemented to encourage FUT players to spend more money, is in every mode and makes every game an unsatisfying and empty experience. Considering a core demographic for this game is children, the income-focused manipulation displayed here is repugnant. \n\nDDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment) or scipting is just ridiculous now. In games against EA's garbage AI, if the game wants your opponent to score, they'll respond to your controller inputs instantly, not the actions of the player you're controlling. Easy tackles with world class defenders will either miss, bounce the ball to another opponent, just outright phase through the ball or even the damn player! Your keeper will do a Matrix-esque dodge of a shot coming directly at them or will spill an easy catch directly into their striker. The most outrageous though, is player switching on loose balls and when contesting headers. The game will sometimes prevent you from switching to a player (even manually with the right stick) if they're close enough to win a loose ball or are in the best position to win a header. They will instead just stand there, staring blankly into the distance, until the opponent wins back possession. It's the most obvious example of the game cheating to achieve the outcome it wants. This stuff is so obvious that I've been able to predict when a goal is coming, just by how many advantages the AI gets. \n\nOther examples:\n- 30 year old fullback with 60 pace will gain an otherworldly burst of speed to get ahead of my winger with 90 pace\n- Players will frequently and deliberately place themselves in a position to lose headers, even if you're instructing them to do the opposite\n- Opposition defenders will basically teleport to tackle you the second you press shoot in the box\n- Your passes will frequently go to a player in the complete opposite direction to the one you've commanded\n- Uncontrolled defenders will randomly clatter someone in the box, giving away a penalty\n- Some of the AI's most outrageous Sunday league fouls just won't be given \n- If the game doesn't want you to score anymore (or has the scoreline it wants to achieve), the opposition will just pass the ball around the back or run all the way back to the keeper upon any pressure. This would be fine if they weren't 2-1 down at 70', where any team would be pushing hard for an equaliser. Again, just breaks the immersion.\n- If the game wants you to score, all of these advantages are removed and opposing players lose 50 IQ points. It's ridiculously transparent. \n\nThese problems extend to all other game modes, especially Ultimate Team. \n\nAt the end of the day, all this does is damage the experience. Wins don't feel earned, since it's obvious that the game is allowing you to win. When you lose it's often because of the above advantages, not from been legitimately outplayed. For a game that aims to recreate football, it fails spectacularly in presenting the core part of that experience; the in-match gameplay. Neglecting this, by adding a scripting or variable difficulty system to psychologically manipulate FUT players to spend more money, not only irrevocably destroys the experience in all modes, but is also outrageously anti-consumer. I knew on reputation that EA Sports games were microtransaction ridden hellholes but this is predatory to a degree I've never seen before.

While the game offers thrilling gameplay and a compelling setting, the experience is frequently undermined by severe server issues that can render it utterly unplayable at times.\n\nAt its core, Darktide nails the essence of cooperative play. Teaming up with friends or even strangers to take on hordes of enemies is exhilarating, and the customization options allow players to tailor their characters to fit their preferred playstyles. The visuals are striking, with environments that draw you deep into the grimdark world of Warhammer. The atmosphere is palpable, making each mission feel intense and rewarding. Balanced gameplay mechanics and a variety of enemy types keep each encounter fresh and engaging.\n\nHowever, the enjoyment of these elements is too often interrupted by connectivity problems. Countless players have reported being booted from matches, facing long matchmaking times, or struggling with instances of lag that severely impact the experience. It's aggravating to finally coordinate a session with friends only to find yourselves repeatedly disconnected or stuck waiting for servers to stabilize. For a game that thrives on teamwork, these technical hurdles can be demoralizing.\n\nThe absence of an offline mode is a significant drawback for those who wish to dive into the game without the burden of server dependency. It feels particularly odd in an era where many games are recognizing the value of offline play, especially for cooperative titles. An offline mode could allow for practice runs, experimentation with character builds, or simply enjoy the game without the anxiety of connectivity issues.\n\nAs it stands, Darktide is a game with a lot of heart and potential but is marred by infrastructural flaws. While the developers have shown commitment to improving the experience with patches and updates, the underlying server issues diminish what could be a stellar gaming experience. The hope is that as development continues, we\u2019ll see a robust and reliable system put in place, allowing players to fully embrace the adventure without the looming threat of disconnection.\n\nIn summary, Darktide offers a great foundation with its intense cooperative gameplay and rich lore, yet it is held back by its current server instability. For now, players may want to proceed with caution, waiting for improvements before fully investing in the experience. The desire for an offline mode adds to the urgency for enhancements, as a smoother game experience could elevate Darktide to its rightful place in the pantheon of memorable co-op shooters.\n", "hours": 5217, "hoursAtReview": 806, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732800194}, {"text": "[h3]The short and sweet review:[/h3] \r\nDarktide, much like its predecessors in the Warhammer fantasy era, serves as a unique twist on L4D style gameplay with RPG elements. Recent updates have improved it a lot, including the new Havoc endgame mode! Worth picking up if coop-based FPS games with RPG elements are your cup of tea.\r\nSolid 8.5/10 for me\r\n\r\n[h3]The long version:[/h3]\r\n[i]Please skip this part of your ADHD doesn't let you focus on waterfalls of text like these. This review is very thorough and gives a chunkier base of information to start with before you play the game.[/i]\r\n\r\nDarktide has had its ups and downs over the years, and the game as it is today is a far more advanced version of what it was on launch.\r\nRather than playing a premade character with their own personality a la Vermintide, you make your own 'reject'. They're called that because they're rescued from a besieged prison ship and are given a slim chance to fight for a new place in the Imperium for helping an Explicator escape from the Chaos forces alive. (This is the tutorial mission, so no spoilies) To note, the rejects have their own personality as well, but some of the identity is mixed due to the 'create your own character' nature of the game.\r\nThe gameplay loop includes dodging, blocking, and dashing to add to the mobility factor and reward skill and timing. Also, stick together, because you're stronger and tankier when you're within allied Coherency!\r\n\r\nThere's five difficulties: Sedition, Uprising, Malice, Heresy, and Damnation. There's also mutator versions of each map that add more enemy types and hazards, and there's Maelstrom/Auric Maelstrom missions for people who want a bigger challenge.\r\n\r\nThe game features four classes:\r\n1) [b]The Veteran[/b], a primarily ranged-focused class specializing in unique and varied ranged weapons at the cost of a more limited pool of melee weapons. Keep in mind, they have a lot of amazing options for both slots, so don't hesitate to try them even if you like melee! They have three distinct styles: Commander, Saboteur, and Gunner. Commander is support-based and makes enemies you mark take more damage, Saboteur uses smoke bombs to confuse enemies and stealths in for empowered attacks, and Gunner highlights enemies and kills elites like it's nothing.\r\n\r\n2) [b]The Zealot[/b] is a melee fanatic who serves the Emperor of Mankind in everything they do. They tend to focus on melee combat, an inverse of the Veteran in the way that they have limited ranged options but a plethora of unique melee armaments. Same thing as before, three styles: Stealth zealot that focuses on assassinating big targets, Scripture-reading zealots that stun enemies and empower allies, and charging zealots who specialize in heavy hits and crowd clearing.\r\n\r\n3) [b]The Ogryn[/b], a big fella with even bigger weapons. They tend to be a bit more niche as their larger frame to block allied shots, so be ready to play them accordingly. Again, three styles: Brute, focusing on charging and knocking enemies around with heavy hits. Then there's the gunner, who makes their ranged weapon stronger, reload on skill activation and fire faster. And finally, there's the tank - they taunt enemies and take severely reduced damage when played correctly.\r\n\r\n4) [b]The Psyker[/b], warp-specialists and likely the hardest the learn but the most satisfying to master. They wield warp staves and warp powers of their own in lieu of a grenade slot, but they have some solid guns and melee weapons as well. As before, there's three types: Support psyker focuses on crowd control and shielding allies, Blade psyker shoots telekinetic blades and empowers their psionics, and Blaze psykers who knock enemies back, set them on fire and clear their 'peril', a mechanic that simulates the warp invading a psyker's mind. TL;DR: These are the casters.\r\n\r\nNow, keep in mind, all of the above can be customized using the in-game talent trees, so you can mix and match buffs, abilities and passives to suit your playstyle! All classes level to 30, so you have plenty of points to tinker with. The above are just a basic idea of some builds.\r\n\r\nOnce you've picked your class, you take on numerous missions: taking back a metal 'fab' (weapons/armor forges), investigating a zone of chaos corruption, assassinating high priority targets, and more. The mission names can be a bit confusing at first as everything is in 40k Imperium code, but you get the idea rather quickly.\r\n\r\nThe enemies forces are comprised of three types:\r\n1) Poxwalkers: Little zombie fellas, easy to kill but numerous\r\n2) Grunts: Tankier than poxwalkers, a bit less numerous but a little bit harder to kill. Some have melee weapons, others have guns!\r\n3) Specials: These range from empowered versions of grunts to mobs that CC and enemies that are super tanky.\r\n\r\nNow for the usual:\r\n\r\n[b]The Good[/b]\r\nGameplay is solid, gunplay even more so, melee weapons feel amazing, and some of the zones you go to are beautiful and truly awe-inspiring to look at. Each class feels unique and strong in its own way, and some weapons truly shine in combat. The gameplay loop can be addicting, especially with the Havoc mode they added (tl;dr: each Havoc mission you complete makes the next Havoc mission harder, but you get greater rewards at higher Havoc clearances). Music is incredible (Thank you, Jesper Kyd), and the sound design (enemy sounds, weapon noises, etc) is equally incredible!\r\n\r\n[b]The Bad[/b]\r\nThis section would have been beefier a year ago, but thankfully updates have improved the game dramatically. That said, it still has its problems. Namely, some weapons, or even just a version of a weapon, feel underwhelming. Please don't ask me to cite examples because, like the maps, the weapons have 'Mark/Mk' based names and titles in Imperium-jargon. Thankfully you can change the marks at any time if you have enough mastery with the weapon, so most of those issues were solved. Also, some bosses are a real slog if you don't have any classes that truly excel at boss killing. It's rare that that happens, but sometimes you have four people who are great at multi-target clearing but are terrible at single-target. Also, to hell with barrels. They knock players back 8000000000 miles to their off-the-map death but only politely nudge enemies. At the very least, I hope they make barrels just as devastating for enemies one day.\r\n\r\n[b]The Uhhh..gly?[/b]\r\nSometimes the netcode in the game can be a lil bit silly. Like when you have a Crusher swinging a big overhead strike at you, you dodge, and two seconds later you take the damage from the swing you successfully avoided. It's rare, but it's annoying when it happens, especially when there's Penances (Achievements) for not going down in a mission. Additionally, when queueing with randoms, sometimes you hit the jackpot and end up with a solid team, and other times you end up with a psyker who never casts, or a zealot who doesn't know what blocking is. It's a mixed bag out there, and some folks are fated to stay 'rejects' for the rest of their days.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall, the 'bad' and 'ugly' sections are very small problems in a game that I find really enjoyable to play. I'm sure some folks will mark this review with a clown medal because of how popular it is to hate positivity these days, but I wanted to give it a review all the same to help gives a thorough (if lengthy) look into the game they're thinking of purchasing it.

If you do not want to go into details, you could easily state briefly that apart from changes in the nomenclature, everything remains the same. It is not appropriate to talk about the beginning of a completely new era of virtual football, and if so, it is a very cautious, even lukewarm beginning.\r\nI certainly do not want to say that FC 24 does not bring anything new, but the news and improvements come in exactly the quantity and scope that you would expect from the new edition of FIFA based on the experience of recent years.\r\nFor example, the range of game modes has not been enriched this year. The story mode The Journey continues to remain in oblivion, as does the Story Mode within the street mode VOLTA. I can tell you straight away that it does not come with any news at all.\r\nBut let's move on to the big field. FC 24 plays very similarly to FIFA 23. After all, we're used to saying that about almost every new installment, but I subjectively perceive the year-on-year difference in the overall feel of the game as even slightly smaller than in the previous two or three years.\r\n\r\nAbove all of the above, there is once again a mode that would easily be enjoyed as a standalone game \u2013 the beloved and hated Ultimate Team. EA has been paying the most attention to this for many years, so it probably won't surprise anyone that most of the new features in FC 24 have gone to UT.\r\n\r\nThe most striking thing is the fact that for the first time this year, male and female footballers can run out onto the pitch side by side. It's an innovation that I was more than skeptical about at first, but I quickly discovered that not only do I not mind it at all, but it's actually a pretty nice change.\r\nWe could argue that it's unrealistic. Yes, it is. In real football, most female players would probably not be able to withstand a match with Erling Haaland. But you just have to look away from the comparison with reality, with which FC, especially Ultimate Team, has little in common anyway. It is actually a pleasant and important variation for the game as such. The girls here are really not just a number.\r\n\r\nAnother big novelty in Ultimate Team is evolution. As the name suggests, the new mechanism allows you to improve existing players, and usually to activate this improvement you just need to complete a relatively simple challenge. Personally, I used evolution to create a team consisting only of Slovak citizens for a whole year, and in the final phase of the game I achieved a team quality similar to the strongest teams in the game, but with the difference that I had completely unique players, while everyone had the same names of world football and legends in the team.\r\n\r\nIn short, EA Sports FC 24 didn't really surprise me with anything other than the decently managed integration of women into Ultimate Team. I got another FIFA with everything I like \u2013 great audiovisual spectacle, fun arcade gameplay, and licenses from the vast majority of major competitions and clubs.

The resource management mechanics of the series return, requiring careful planning when dealing with enemies or navigating environments.

Intense, action-heavy sequences are balanced by slower, exploration-focused sections. One standout area, House Beneviento, shifts the focus entirely to psychological horror, delivering one of the most memorable and spine-chilling moments in the series.\r\n\r\n[h2]Graphics and Performance[/h2]\r\nThe RE Engine shines again, delivering photorealistic visuals and smooth performance across platforms. Character models, particularly Lady Dimitrescu and her daughters, are stunningly detailed. Lighting plays a significant role in creating a foreboding atmosphere, while subtle environmental details draw you into the world.\r\n\r\n[h2]Replay Value[/h2]\r\nVillage offers plenty of reasons to return after the credits roll.

Thought I'd quit sooner than I did. A lot of my hours admittedly are afk hours watching Youtube on another monitor.\n\nIts hard to organize my thoughts and explain what I liked and didn't about this game. There are things to do, you can sleep to skip time, the work has an oddly satisfying quality about it watching the field textures change. There are things I'd change however...\n\nUnless you use mods to dump your starting money, the sense of progression while playing is almost non-existent. Too much of the early game is just sleeping to skip time. All work and no play. No life.\n\nIts kind of my problem with these sim games. The Truck sim games don't even have a character you play because the truck is the character you play. Its truck sim, not trucker sim. Forgive me but I honestly think trucker sim would be a better game.\n\nI also think farmer sim would be a better game. While playing Farming Sim 22, there was one game it reminded me of. Shenmue. Shenmue is a slice of life game that some might argue is still ahead of its time. Anyways, there comes a part in Shenmue where you get a forklift job to make money. There is also a day-night and seasons systems in Shenmue. You could go to a bar and play darts. Purchase collectibles and games. Talk to people. Learn new Tekken fighting moves.\n\nThen I'd be playing FS22 wishing I could go in the gas station and buy something. The Taco restaurant to get food. The bowling ally to bowl. The grocery store for food. Hire people that exist in the game map instead of magic AI bots. I don't want to be forced to sleep at 7 am over and over. There should be meaningful gameplay to do when you have nothing else to do. Small life sim elements similar to Shenmue would solve that problem.\n\nI doubt it will ever happen. FS22 is for FS1-19 players and they tend to push back from highly beneficial change that would bring in new players. Gatekeeping seemingly a fans top priority I guess.\n\nBeing a chores sim with mods, the most popular mods remove excessive tedium in the game. Mods like autoload to load supplies on trucks/trailers so you don't have to deal with forklifts or cranes (they're bad). Lumberjack a mod that lets you remove tree stumps and active super strength. Super strength being a massive boon in fixing flipped vehicles or stuck trailers. Without it, you'd have to use what the game provides and spend lots of time solving an unfun problem.\n\nEven with mods, the game gets monotonous and tedious doing the same chores over and over. My hours are all on the same map and I downloaded many maps to try. I just can't be bothered now. No Man's Land with the start with nothing mod. \n\nI know it sounds like a negative review, but its alright.

However, if the new DEV team sticks with it, it will continue to grow. It's just a matter of continuing to push updates out and improving the engine (eventually at least to Unreal 4). The fact that people mistake this for Fortnite, constantly, because they would have looked the same in a year long past now, means it's popular enough to even be referenced against. Hitboxes are HUGE. The game allows you to be 'bad' but still be an okay player.\n\nCrossplay is the only way to go right now as if you don't, you may not find a lobby to play in. Peak hours of filled lobbies seem to be between Noon CST till around 7pm. That's way better than how it was where it seemed 'dead' all the time.\n\nIMO there's a LOT that still needs to be done. The former 'pros' still destroy people and if they continue to campy camp newer or just plain NEW players to this game, they'll not want to come back. Only way to really fix that is SBMM or add different modes like specifically ranked for the pros that want to fight others on their level and/or public type lobbies (like many other BR's have). I know that's probably way down the road, but it's going to have to happen to draw the players that can only play a couple hours a night because of their busy lives (aka casuals).\n\nThey've put some work into the new skins. New Battle Pass with this last update in November. New class, or rather a class brought back from Alpha. Rumors of another new class down the line.

I don't mean just slugging the last two survivors either, I mean slugging all four within the first few minutes of a game. This used to be a rare occurrence, but now I'll have it happen multiple times back to back. It's so infuriating and there's only a handful of ways for survivors to counteract it, which are even more difficult to do if you're playing solo and have zero communication or coordination with your teammates. There's a penalty timer for disconnecting too, so if you end up in a game like this you can either waste your time bleeding out on the floor, or waste your time in the lobby waiting for the matchmaking penalty to go away.

The game's sound design is equally impressive, with every gunshot, explosion, and demon scream contributing to the immersive experience.\r\n\r\nWhile Doom Eternal is a demanding game, it rewards mastery with a sense of pure, unadulterated power. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock new weapons, abilities, and upgrades, allowing you to customize your playstyle and dominate the battlefield. The game's difficulty curve is challenging but fair, providing a sense of accomplishment as you overcome each obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Doom Eternal is a must-play for any fan of first-person shooters.

From its explosive combat to its breathtaking visuals, DOOM Eternal is an exhilarating experience that sets a new standard for first-person shooters. Here\u2019s why it deserves all the praise it\u2019s received.\n\n1. Mind-Blowing Combat\nAt the heart of DOOM Eternal is its fast-paced, visceral combat. The developers at id Software have crafted an experience that\u2019s both deeply satisfying and endlessly engaging. The game encourages an aggressive playstyle, where you\u2019re constantly on the move, dodging, jumping, and firing at enemies from all angles. There\u2019s no room for slow, methodical play here \u2013 it\u2019s all about momentum.\n\nWhat really sets the combat apart from other shooters is the way it forces you to think on your feet. Each enemy type has its own behavior and weaknesses, and the game gives you the tools to deal with them in unique ways. The chainsaw provides a brutal, ammo-restoring kill, while the flamethrower is perfect for dealing with fodder enemies and adding extra damage to tougher foes. The combat loops are smooth, satisfying, and constantly evolving as you progress, with new weapons and abilities introduced at just the right moments to keep things fresh.\n\nThe Glory Kill system, where you can perform brutal finishing moves on stunned enemies, is an excellent way to add a satisfying rhythm to the combat. It\u2019s visceral, it\u2019s aggressive, and it\u2019s empowering. Add in the variety of weapons like the Super Shotgun (with its Meat Hook attachment) and the rocket launcher, and you have a deadly arsenal at your disposal that feels as good to wield as it does to use.\n\n2. Incredible Visual Design\nThe visuals in DOOM Eternal are absolutely stunning. The game runs on a heavily optimized version of id Software's id Tech 7 engine, and it shows. From the terrifyingly grotesque demon designs to the stunning, detailed environments, every visual element is designed with a high level of care and precision. The art direction here is a standout achievement.\n\nThe game\u2019s levels are diverse, from hellish landscapes to high-tech military bases, and each one is packed with secrets, challenges, and layers of depth. The level of detail is insane, and the amount of world-building through environmental storytelling is impressive. You\u2019ll often find yourself stopping for a moment just to take in the scenery, something you might not expect from a game focused so heavily on intense combat.\n\nThe lighting and atmosphere are also masterfully crafted. The game\u2019s lighting is dynamic, casting dramatic shadows that enhance the mood and tension during combat. Whether you're exploring the towering, doom-laden structures of Hell or an abandoned base on Earth, the visual design adds an immersive layer to the gameplay experience.\n\n3. Engaging Story and World-Building\nWhile the DOOM series has never been known for its narrative depth, DOOM Eternal brings an unexpected level of lore and world-building to the table. The story, which revolves around the Doom Slayer\u2019s quest to stop the demonic invasion of Earth, is rich with details and history. You get glimpses of the ancient history of the Doom Slayer, the origins of Hell\u2019s demons, and the larger cosmic struggle that has been taking place for millennia.\n\nThe game also introduces characters like the mysterious \"Seraphim\" and the recurring antagonist, the Khan Maykr, whose motives gradually unfold over the course of the game. The cutscenes, while few in number, are powerful and add weight to the stakes, giving you a reason to care about the world you're fighting to save. This is a notable improvement from the previous entry, where story elements were largely relegated to background details.\n\n4. Unmatched Sound Design and Music\nThe soundtrack of DOOM Eternal is a work of art. Composed by Mick Gordon, the music in this game is an absolute force. The heavy metal-infused soundtrack perfectly complements the fast-paced, aggressive gameplay, with thundering guitar riffs and pounding drums that get your blood pumping.\n\nThe sound design across the board is excellent, from the deep growls of demonic enemies to the satisfying sounds of gunfire and explosions. It all comes together to create an audio experience that is as immersive and intense as the gameplay itself.\n\n5. Challenge and Replayability\nDOOM Eternal is a challenging game, but in a way that feels rewarding rather than frustrating. The difficulty settings are perfectly balanced, allowing players to push their skills while still having access to a variety of assists for those who want a more relaxed experience. The game never holds your hand, and that's part of what makes it so gratifying when you finally overcome its many obstacles.\n\nAdditionally, DOOM Eternal is packed with secrets, upgrades, and collectibles that will keep you coming back long after you\u2019ve completed the main campaign. The challenge runs, which task you with completing a set of combat scenarios in a given time limit, offer an extra layer of replayability for those looking to test their skills.\n\n6. Seamless Movement and Platforming\nUnlike its predecessors, DOOM Eternal adds a surprising amount of platforming to the mix. The game introduces mechanics like wall-running, dashing, and climbing, which work perfectly with the high-speed combat. These platforming elements provide additional layers of depth, allowing you to traverse the environment in new ways and keep you constantly engaged.\n\nThe fluidity of movement is exceptional. You can seamlessly go from blasting enemies to leaping across platforms without missing a beat, and it feels natural. This addition might not be for everyone, but for those who enjoy the variety it brings, it is a welcome and exciting change.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, DOOM Eternal is a masterclass in modern game design. It takes everything that made DOOM (2016) great and expands upon it in every way. With its intense combat, jaw-dropping visuals, engaging story, and heart-pounding soundtrack, it stands as one of the most exciting and satisfying first-person shooters ever made. Whether you're a longtime fan of the series or a newcomer, DOOM Eternal is an absolute must-play experience that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.", "hours": 529, "hoursAtReview": 488, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733127025}, {"text": "My after care.

My only complaints are that the Hell Razer isn't in this game, you can't play as the Arachnotron in battlemode, and the fact that you can't have an option to have a computer player in battlemode (like in smash bros.). But other than those three issues, \n\n9/10", "hours": 2088, "hoursAtReview": 1925, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734284960}, {"text": "In short: This game doesn't need a review. It's good. It's fun. You can run it on a toaster. Get it.\r\n\r\nLonger summation: DOOM Eternal took the DOOM 2016 formula, threw it out, doubled down on dynamic combat and weapons, expanded the lore/story, and let Mick Gordon have a bit more creative control over the soundtrack. While I wasn't impressed by DOOM 2016, from gameplay to the story, Eternal felt like almost a different game entirely with many welcomed changes.\r\n\r\nCombat: The meat and potatoes of the FPS genre. The combat for Eternal is visceral, rewarding, has an addicting loop, and has much more engaging enemies with their own attack patterns and weaknesses. Once you learn the ropes of the loop, learn counters for enemies, and get into a rhythm, it's borderline hypnotic when you are locked in. Glory kills play more of a role in the sequel, being basically required to keep the flow of combat going for ammo, armor, etc. One new enemy is the Marauder, an enemy that has abilities similar to the Doomslayer player character. He uses dashes, a shotgun, summons demon dogs, and is an absolute blast to fight. The Marauder encounters are usually 1-on-1, but are a fun mental game of rock, paper, scissors while you both zip around the arena trying to kill each other. Beating demons is less about brute force in this game and more of countering with specific weapon types. This helps the weapons not feel same-y like they did in DOOM 2016.\r\n\r\nExploration: A lot more collectibles, extras, secrets, and replayability that rewards exploration. More movement options like wall climbing and mid-air dashing makes getting around the maps fun and expedient.\r\n\r\nMusic: Full stop, probably the best soundtrack I've heard from an arcade shooter in my entire life. The techno-metal rock with crunchy riffs, gutteral yelling, and heavy bass hits compliment the combat very, very well. The first time I heard the music when fighting different hoards of demons made it a totally different experience from the first game. I saw a review from a smaller YouTuber back in 2020 where he basically said \"The music and combat in this game is... a pretty hardcore experience. Listen to the game on full volume while you fight. Between the music, singers yelling and chanting, while demons scream as you rip them apart, like, I had to pause the game and get up for a second because it was just so much stimulation at once. My heartbeat would increase and stuff. It was pretty awesome.\" I thought he was being dramatic, but no, I totally get it after playing for the first time. It's a great soundtrack. Great for lifting in the gym, too.\r\n\r\nThere's also loads of costumes for the slayer, even the demons for multiplayer. The DLCs are good if you enjoyed the base game. I urge you to not play this game on the easiest difficulty. You get extra lives (plenty of them) instead of hard checkpoints, kind of like the older games, but they serve as revives during fights. Falling off the map also isn't an instant game over, you just lose some health and get reset on the map. If you're not a games journalist, this game isn't hard unless you purposefully make it that way or ignore the \"rules\" of the combat system.", "hours": 1510, "hoursAtReview": 1510, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734284685}, {"text": "Sometimes u just wanna rip a guy in half, and this game's good for those times. \r\n\r\nThis is also one of the few games that gets more fun the harder it is, so I'd recommend trying out nightmare on it.", "hours": 2048, "hoursAtReview": 2048, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734224238}], "name": "DOOM Eternal"}, "949230": {"reviews": [{"text": "To put it fairly, Cities: Skylines II isn't bad because it's abandoned or given any false promises. But rather, this game was built on weak foundations and has been heavily misdirected to keep stacking on them. The disaster of CS2 is a combination of over ambition, terrible risk management and project planning. The past one year of work by devs have not addressed any of its fundamental flaws and they are now already trying to resume selling cosmetics for coins, which is why I have to add another thumb down for it.\n\n\nCS2's key feature and improvement over CS1 is the much more diversified economy system with individual level citizen needs and more types of supply & demand. The bad news is this system has never worked. They started with embedding fake dummy figures to make it [i]look [/i]functional, then, after being picked out by players, reworked the math two or three times (I lost count if we are at economy 2.0 or 3.0). [b][i]It still does not work. [/i][/b] And more crucially, players have little to no way to make it work.\n\n\nThere are only very limited micro management tools which makes 80% of the stat charts in the game pointless - you can stare at them, but there is no way to respond to them. What's the point of having dozens of industry types when I can't even assign a district or building to a specific industry? What's the point of having a patch to \"give more salary to employees\" instead of making it something adjustable (e.g. minimum wage or income tax rate) in the first place?\n\nCS2 essentially introduced an overly complex model to replace what's trivial but working in CS1, to achieve the exact same goal - to generate district demands - but failed to provide enough tools to players to integrate it as part of gameplay. There are so many gaps and vacancies between this simulation and the actual gameplay, that are either reserved for DLCs or simply overlooked. However, instead of filling the gaps by providing more policy tools,  more specialized city service types etc, the devs have only been cooking and recooking the math of the simulation... which is quite pointless.\n\n\nThis makes CS2 not qualify for a city simulation game. It's at best a [i]scene building [/i]game that is no way worth $40. Adding on with the performance downfalls, the modding dramas, and the unending list of [i]small [/i]bugs - all lead to the very same question: [b]why would you release the game in 2023, if it is still not ready after one year?[/b]", "hours": 5523, "hoursAtReview": 4557, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733123489}, {"text": "City Skylines 2: A Huge Step Backward!!!\n\nI\u2019ve been a dedicated fan of City Skylines 1, pouring over 1,200 hours into that game and thoroughly enjoying every moment of city-building and management.

I understand the public\u2019s remarks, but I still think it makes sense for Hades II to stick to its original foundational concepts, just with new Gods, questlines, regions, bosses, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the end, I am glad that the team not only listens to its community but also stays true to the concept of the first game.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I\u2019d like to make a small table of things I REALLY LIKED and things that might still need improvement.\r\n\r\nPROS:\r\n\r\nTHE SOUNDTRACKS \u2013 This is probably the best part of the entire game, and I don\u2019t mean that in a negative way regarding everything else. The music is just reaaaaally good.\r\nThe Mechanics \u2013 While they haven\u2019t been completely overhauled, there are still quite a lot of changes to the mechanics, and I am fond of them.\r\nThe Art Style \u2013 As always, no game from Supergiant disappoints when it comes to art style.\r\nThe Gameplay \u2013 With such a wide variety of choices\u2014boons, hammers, arcane cards, pets, weapons, weapon arts\u2014the game could hardly ever get boring.\r\nThe Amount of Personas \u2013 The number of NPCs in the game is just HUGE, and I find it extremely intriguing to meet and explore their personalities and questlines, hear their voices, and admire their designs.\r\nThe Price \u2013 The price is so good for a game of this quality that I honestly think it should cost more to better reflect the team\u2019s efforts.\r\n\r\nCONS:\r\n\r\nThe Mobs \u2013 Maybe the only thing I am not particularly fond of is the mob spawn rate and the mobs themselves. It feels quite unfair in some stages, such as Mount Olympus or Tartarus, where 1,000 mobs are constantly spawning with insane attacks and attack patterns. One example of a completely UNFAIR mob would be the Dracon. This mini-boss gave me a harder time than Prometheus or even the God of Time himself! Nevertheless, I hope and believe they will make some changes to this in future updates.\r\n\r\nWith all that said, I conclude that the game is AMAZING.

I don\u2019t care what anyone else says; if you haven\u2019t experienced this game, you\u2019re a fool living in the dark ages of gaming. Ark doesn\u2019t just redefine the genre\u2014Ark is the genre. Forget everything you know about video games, because Ark demands that you bow before it.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the visuals. The graphics in Ark are not just beautiful\u2014they're a brutal, soul-crushing assault on your senses that will leave you with an existential crisis. The landscapes are so vibrant, so shockingly detailed, you\u2019ll want to lick your screen just to absorb more of the overwhelming beauty. Forests are alive with vibrant greens, beaches gleam with the relentless sun, and the creatures, my God, the creatures! The dinosaurs are so lifelike, you\u2019ll believe that you\u2019ve stumbled into a reality where humanity was never born, and you\u2019re just another cog in the ecosystem of primeval predators. Nothing else compares.\n\nAnd the gameplay? It's not just a game. Ark is a test of human survival instincts, intellect, and willpower. Most games throw a few obstacles at you, but Ark doesn\u2019t ask for your participation\u2014it demands your obedience. If you\u2019re not constantly micromanaging your survival, you\u2019re not playing the game right. Each moment spent in the wilderness is a battle to avoid extinction. Every move you make is scrutinized by an AI that seems to sense your every weakness. Will you fight? Will you survive? Or will you become another snack for a T-Rex?\n\nThe crafting system is nothing short of divine. It\u2019s not just about gathering resources and building\u2014it\u2019s about creating an empire from the ground up. It\u2019s about establishing dominance. Every shelter you construct, every weapon you forge, is a statement to the world that you are a god among mere mortals. And don\u2019t even get me started on the taming mechanics. The sheer satisfaction of breaking a wild beast to your will is unmatched. Tame a dinosaur, and you don't just control a creature; you assert your power over the universe itself. The moment you see a massive, terrifying creature like a Giganotosaurus bow to your will, you\u2019ll experience a primal thrill that you won\u2019t find in any other medium.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the multiplayer experience. The other players in Ark? Oh, they\u2019re not just competitors\u2014they\u2019re prey. The sense of dominance you\u2019ll feel as you crush their fragile little settlements beneath the boots of your raptors is intoxicating. Forming alliances? That\u2019s for the weak. You don\u2019t need allies when you have a tribe of bloodthirsty monsters and the ruthless will to conquer. PvP in Ark is not about fun; it\u2019s about survival at its most primal, a constant reminder that the weak are doomed, and the strong will rule forever. Betrayals, backstabbing, and merciless raids\u2014these are the things that will make your blood pump as you laugh maniacally over the ruins of your enemies.\n\nDo I sound like a psychopath? Good. Because that\u2019s exactly what Ark: Survival Evolved does to you. It turns you into a god of chaos, a puppet master of survival, pulling strings with the ease of a master torturer. The emotional rollercoaster this game will put you through is the equivalent of being in a warzone without the slightest hope for mercy. The thrill of having your base raided at 3 AM is something only the truly evolved can appreciate. If you\u2019re not waking up in a cold sweat from nightmares about your lost creatures and ruined crops, you\u2019re not playing Ark right.\n\nIn conclusion, Ark: Survival Evolved isn\u2019t just a game\u2014it\u2019s a journey into madness, a brutal, unforgiving world where only the strongest survive. If you\u2019re not ready for that, you can\u2019t possibly understand its brilliance. This game isn\u2019t for the weak. It\u2019s for the vicious, the cunning, and those willing to embrace their inner monster. So what are you waiting for?

I have been a fan of the sims franchise for years and grew up playing it. I've always had an affinity for the series and I can't help but feel as though EA has squandered this game forever. The fact that you have to pay over $1000 (and over $800 with half of the packs being 30-50% off) for all of the game content, tied together with the terrible coding and stupid bugs, this is basically an incomplete game. There is quite literally not a single other game on the market like this, and EA gets away with it. Why? Because we let them. Every single person who has bought a pack or feed into the cycle of buying shitty packs (myself included) is part of the problem. EA has a monopoly, and they know that. They continue to release packs because they continue to be bought. I don't think this cycle of endless DLC will ever end really. I only have a few of the packs, and I am constantly running into issues running this game even though my PC is fairly good. The base game is very boring, and without any of the packs, provided an extremely lackluster experience. The lack of sims personality is a particularly weird thing considering the personality was supposed to be the whole point! There are features that are needlessly complex but don't actually have any real weight in the game or do nothing! Not to mention there are several features in packs that will only work if you have another completely different separate pack! \n\nThe game moved very away from some of it's adult theme's additionally. They seem to be marketing the game more towards younger children and the game is very turoialy and hand holdy. It takes much much more for your sims to die, and while this could be a good thing to prevent stupid deaths from happening, in my experience it just makes the game less fun. Part of the fun of the sims is how crazy and outlandish you could make your sims stories, with affairs and magic and ghosts etc! Half of these features are now not present in sims 4, or are locked behind packs and expansions. The game itself just has such a different vibe from the rest of the series, and i wouldn't say thats a good thing! I feel so isolated when I play the sims 4 because nothing is ever happening. Your sims can't get fired, they can't cheat, etc, a lot of the features that made the sims *feel* like a life sim arent even there anymore!! \n\nI basically play this game now as a dress-up game and a building sim, as in my eyes it doesn't have much to offer, and now hearing there won't be a sims 5, i think this is probably the end of the road for the sims. Don't get me wrong it is still very popular, but I genuinely can't see people putting up with this shit for very much longer. \n\nThe way this game has left a permanent stain in my eyes on the sims franchise is crazy, imo. And while i do still love the games and will continue to play them, I cannot in good faith recommend this to any single other person. It's terribly coded, 10 yrs old at this point, and continually getting DLC released for it without any of the actual issues being addressed. I would really like to see EA move this franchise away from both micro-transactions and the more family-friendly approach they seem to have taken with the game. But that's wishful thinking, and I know it, especially considering what we know about \"Project Rene\". \n\n^^ if you weren't aware there have already been talks by EA to take the seasons pack and split it up into 4 separate packs for Project Rene. *not confirmed, but discussed", "hours": 13914, "hoursAtReview": 8482, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733095514}, {"text": "too many add ons and expansions, the base game gets boring and then you need to spend 50 bucks to do something else.", "hours": 1537, "hoursAtReview": 1216, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733301285}, {"text": "I have a good time playing it, and I am always find new things to do even after playing for more than 1800 hours.

I recommend playing the game mod free or with as few mods as possible in your first playthrough tho, The game is already very very good as it is! \n\nThe Combat system is somewhat hectic and needs getting used to. I understand why many players would be dismayed by it, especially in situations against multiple opponents where you just feel like a slab of cheese gettin pushed into a grater. Worst mistake I've done is unknowingly skipped the last sword tutorial part with the knight guy and spent like a third of the game unable to do a \"Master Strike\" before realizing why I'm unable to. Combat can be quite satisfying tho once you get over the hurdle.\n\nThe Storyline might be the most historically accurate compared to any other video game, so yeah! it feels like you go back in time often and wonder how lives really were around that time period. \n\nLastly are the Random Events, They are great!

The Combat tries to have directional combat, it tries to have blocks, it tries to have feints.  But none of it matters.  None of it.  Zero. Not long into the game, you unlock a parry. If you Press the block button at just the right time, you take no damage, lose no stamina, and DO damage to the attacker.  This one ability renders the entire combat system irrelevant.  Worse, enemies can do this parry as well, meaning that every time you attack, you're risking damage.  The only exception is for the magical super parry you can do, which cannot be parried... so not only is it a super ability that bypasses the whole combat system, doing literally anything else in combat is actively and constantly punished.  The direction system doesn't matter, feints don't matter.  Enemies can parry everything, and so can you, so just do that.\n\nSo yeah, 1v1 combat is pointless and stupid.  Even at low levels once you have the parry, you're basically invincible in 1v1s once you master it...which isn't fun.  Luckily that's not a problem because enemy encounters are always 5v1 ganks.  The game has basically no way to combat multiple enemies that isn't just doing 1v1 combat while running backwards across the planet, so still bad.  It's a nightmare just trying to have the game change the target it automatically locks you onto. The controls for combat outside 1v1 are just pure misery.\n\nPeople insist that the game is focused on \"realism\".  But all I can see are inconsistencies.  Henry is not supposed to be a master swordsman out of the gate...but he is. With the super parry I was kicking the teachers butt within an hour, and all my stats are still low.  Those things literally don't matter.  I've also had scripted events where towns people walk up to me have have some sort of conversation with me....but I happen to be miles away from town in the woods.  How did that person get all the way out here?  How did they not get killed by the 5v1 gank squads?  Is this realism?  The game is just too silly for how seriously it takes itself.  I don't buy the \"realism\" argument at all.\n\nBonus. The game basically uses Resident Evil Ink ribbons for saves...so yeah... Better hope it doesn't freeze on a loading screen (it does).  Better hope you don't randomly find a 5v1 gank squad going to a quest marker from literally the first side-quests possible (you will).  Really, a big problem with this game is that it doesn't let you play through your mistakes. You just kind of die. The only way to make real progress in this game is to just avoid most of it. Play it safe.  Appearently you can eventually make the ink ribbons...so why have them in the first place?  Just to make the early game even worse? The early game didn't really need any help in that department.\n\nEveryone online says the game eventually gets better when you get used to it. I'm 19 hours in, and I only found glaring and unenjoyable problems.  Maybe it's worth it if you can see past those things, but honestly I don't recommend anyone try.

Lots of filler dialogue that can generally be skipped over, but if you still know the overarching plot then it's worth being invested. Doesn't shine in an \"mmo way\" since the only group activities are instanced dungeons and boss fights. It is still worth going through even when alone.\n\n[h2]Side Quests:[/h2]\nNot worth the rewards they give you. Most people don't do them, and most are pretty boring. A few can be amusing. e.g. [spoiler]An emotional chocobo breeder had her chocobo stolen by poachers. We tracked down the poachers and found chocobo wings/thighs cooked and plated. Breeder proceeds to... initiate a mukbang saying she can't let it go to waste?[/spoiler]\n\n[h2]Combat:[/h2]\nEach class (\"job\") has unique aesthetic. Lots of cool looking weapons and armor to collect through combat. Some gear can only be worn by certain classes. You can play every class on the same character. \nOutside of main story content, if you don't play optimally people will probably link you to a community resource called \"balance.\" Personally, I recommend to play the way you want, not the way people tell you to.\n\n[h2]Community:[/h2]\nMany people continue their subscriptions only for community aspects of the game. You can meet a lot of great people. The people you interact with the most will be your guild (\"free company\"). They do not have to be the people you do raids/end-game content with, and often are not. \nNot a lot of overworld interaction because most content is done within instances. Most will be spontaneous and last a few moments.\nVia player housing, people will host a variety of events. Typically these are nightclubs, cafes, fightclubs, etc. Many will offer  e-escort services and gambling for in-game money. Personally, I don't have much experience engaging with clubs and cafes, but I can see the appeal.\nMany will use third-party tools to modify how they look and act in-game. Body, emotes, clothing, etc. This is against TOS, and goes on a \"don't ask, don't tell\" basis (that is, only communicate about it outside of game such as in discord). There is a lot of detail I can't explain but just know if you see \"mare\" in-game it is likely related.\n\n[h2]End-game Battle Content/Other Content:[/h2]\nNew end-game content is rarely added. Considering gameplay alone, it can get boring since it's repetitive. One weekly raid and some daily dungeons and boss fights. A lot of reskinned \"go here kill this.\" \nPeople will typically tell you to do combat content from past expansions to fill content gaps. This content isn't boring per se, but you won't be at max level. \nThere's a lot of content which can be fun to see for the first few times. Most turn into a massive grind. At the end of the day, everything is more fun with friends.\nGathering and crafting can be fun to learn, and many people only play to gather and craft. Gathering is very accessible, and only efficiency is limited by gear. Crafting can be difficult to get into since you need the best gear for the latest content, which can be expensive.\n\n[h2]Raids/High-end Content:[/h2]\nOverall not necessary to get into, and most people don't. But play long enough and it's one of the only things that people do. \nThe raid community is elitist and ruled by a website called fflogs: a tracker for how much damage you deal relative to others. Another popular and used website, tracking how far you've progressed through a fight, is called tomestone. It's common for public groups found via the in-game \"party finder\" to check and remove people via data on these websites. \nThere is nuance that can't be explained unless you see for yourself. Exceptions exist to what's stated above, but it's generally true.\nIf you engage with this content, please remember we are all human.\n\n[h2]TLDR:[/h2]\nThe main story is good enough to play solo.

It was a game that popped up in my Steam recommendations one fateful evening when I was feeling particularly adventurous. The title sounded intriguing, the artwork was colorful and whimsical, and the description promised an innovative co-op puzzle experience. It seemed like a fun, lighthearted way to pass a few hours. Little did I know that the next few days would haunt me for far longer than I ever expected.\r\n\r\nAt first, the premise seemed innocent enough. In *Chained Together*, you play as two characters who are literally chained to each other\u2014think of it as a quirky twist on the typical platformer puzzle game. You need to work together, solving environmental challenges while being forced to rely on each other to progress. Sounds charming, right? The kind of game you\u2019d laugh at with a friend, maybe get stuck on a tricky puzzle or two, but nothing too intense.\r\n\r\nBut I was wrong. So, so wrong.\r\n\r\nThe first few levels were fine\u2014if a bit awkward. The controls felt clunky, like the characters were fighting the chain that bound them together every time I moved. The characters themselves were cartoonish, but that didn\u2019t hide the fact that the mechanics were frustrating as hell. I couldn\u2019t get the characters to walk in sync without getting stuck on corners or colliding into each other in the most infuriating ways. Sure, it was a \"learning curve\" at first, but the more I played, the more I realized that the game wasn\u2019t challenging in a fun way\u2014it was challenging in a *misguided, infuriating* way. \r\n\r\nAnd that\u2019s when the game started to show its true colors. The puzzles. Oh god, the puzzles. *Chained Together* starts off innocently enough\u2014moving crates, flipping switches, jumping over gaps. But as you progress, the difficulty spikes, and the puzzles quickly transform into sadistic, hair-pulling exercises in *masochism*. What\u2019s supposed to be a fun co-op game became a sick test of patience and endurance.\r\n\r\nThe first level where things went completely off the rails was one where you had to swing both characters across a series of platforms. No problem, right? Except the game\u2019s physics were so unpredictable that my characters would often fly off the edges or fail to grab onto a ledge, even though I was clearly in the right position. I must have spent *hours* on this one level, only for the game to continue punishing me with impossible jumps and increasingly tight timing. \r\n\r\nI started to hate the characters. I started to hate the physics. I started to hate the *game*. I found myself screaming at the screen. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just move in sync for once?! Why is this so *unnecessary*?\u201d My friends, who had initially been excited to play with me, were soon fed up. They quit after a few hours, each one finding some excuse to bail out. \u201cThis game\u2019s too buggy,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stand the controls,\u201d \u201cThis is just *stupid*.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I kept playing. I kept grinding through level after level, each one more miserable than the last, like I was trying to prove something\u2014perhaps to myself, perhaps to the game. I convinced myself, \u201cThis will get better. I\u2019ll get better.\u201d But it didn\u2019t. Every time I solved a puzzle, it felt like it wasn\u2019t because I was clever, but because the game had finally *allowed* me to pass. There was no sense of accomplishment\u2014just a draining sense of inevitability. \u201cOkay, I solved this one\u2026 but the next one is going to be worse.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt didn\u2019t take long before *Chained Together* had completely broken me. The longer I played, the more I realized how every mechanic, every challenge, and every flaw in the game seemed designed to make me *feel* like a failure. My sense of progress became a cruel illusion. I was moving backward in a constant loop of frustration and rage. I could never get through an entire puzzle without being bombarded with bugs, wonky physics, and asinine level design that defied all logic.\r\n\r\nThe worst part wasn\u2019t even the puzzles themselves\u2014it was the constant sense of *dread*. The kind of dread you get when you\u2019re stuck in a cycle and you can\u2019t see a way out. I began to develop a visceral anxiety every time I launched the game. The moment the loading screen hit, my stomach would churn. The sound of the characters\u2019 voices, their repetitive, chirpy lines, would make me cringe. The music, which was supposed to be lighthearted and fun, now felt like a mockery of everything that was wrong with the game. It was like a countdown to my own personal torture.\r\n\r\nAnd the trauma? Oh, it was real. It wasn\u2019t just the anger and frustration; it was the *emotional exhaustion*. I would play for hours, my hands cramping, my mind numb from the constant failure. Each failed attempt dug deeper into my psyche, until I started to dread the game not just as an annoyance, but as something actively *damaging*. I began having vivid dreams about the game\u2014dreams where the characters were chasing me, where I couldn\u2019t get them to line up in sync no matter how hard I tried. The feeling of being \u201cchained\u201d to something that wouldn\u2019t let me move forward took on a nightmarish quality. The puzzles didn\u2019t stay in the game; they followed me into my waking life.\r\n\r\nEvery time I loaded up the game again, the anxiety would hit. My heart would race, my palms would sweat, and the familiar sense of doom would settle over me. What was once a cute co-op puzzle game had become a psychological prison. I couldn't escape it. I\u2019d go through a cycle of intense frustration, screaming at the screen, then a sort of grim acceptance, followed by a breakdown. It felt like the game was playing with me, punishing me for my own hubris in thinking that I could \"beat it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter I reached a level that required precise timing to dodge fast-moving obstacles while controlling both characters, I *completely* snapped. I spent hours trying to get both characters through the obstacle course, timing my jumps and movements to perfection, only to watch one of them get stuck on an invisible corner or fall off a platform because of the game\u2019s unpredictable mechanics. I felt like I was losing my mind. It wasn\u2019t even fun anymore. I was simply enduring.\r\n\r\nEventually, I couldn't take it anymore. I uninstalled the game, but the damage had already been done. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it. I\u2019d sit at my desk, staring at the blank screen, replaying every failure in my head, wondering if I could have done something differently. The anxiety lingered, and I realized that my experience with *Chained Together* had become more than just a bad gaming experience\u2014it had affected me deeply. Every time I encountered a puzzle game after that, my stomach would tighten. The idea of being forced into a repetitive cycle of frustration brought back waves of anger and helplessness.\r\n\r\nNow, when I see a game that promises \"co-op fun\" or \"challenging puzzles,\" I get this overwhelming sense of dread. The trauma of playing *Chained Together* has lingered in a way I never imagined. It wasn\u2019t just the game\u2014it was the emotional toll, the way it drained my energy, my joy, and my patience. I feel a sense of PTSD whenever I think about it. The worst part is knowing I could have just walked away at any point\u2014but I didn\u2019t. And that, perhaps, is the most terrifying thing of all: I was hooked, helpless to stop my descent into madness.\r\n\r\nIf you're even *thinking* about playing *Chained Together*, take my advice: **don\u2019t.** No amount of whimsical graphics or cute characters can hide the fact that this game will *destroy you*\u2014mentally, emotionally, and maybe even a little bit of your soul.

The gameplay and movement is an overall improvement but i dont personally like the environments nearly as much as BL2, and BL2 had just as much or more variety in the areas compared to this game despite having different planets to explore. The vault hunters are honestly pretty boring in their personality. Moze is basic and boring, and Amara can't stop talking about punching things, which is somewhat standard compared to the other games but its more evident and annoying in this game. Moze is a fun character to play, and is who i played on my first playthrough, this time i chose Amara and honestly i find her somewhat weak and boring compared to the others. Her grasp and orb are finicky, the grasp tends to fail if youre not directly on the enemy, and also has a range limit thats pretty low. The amount of enemies that actually can be grasped is pretty annoying too. The orb gets stuck on everything so its pretty much useless in more cluttered areas. That was my experience with it anyways. I do like the customization of the skill trees and think its a neat concept. I look forward to trying Zane and Fl4k at some point but the story is such a drag to get through that i'm not sure when i'll actually feel like going through it again. The DLCs are better, but not amazing, and the same goes for the writing in them. But sadly youre not going to find Tiny Tinas Attack on Dragon's Keep or Claptastic Voyage levels of an experience. There's also the issues with legendaries, i just don't truthfully love most of them? I feel like for them to be legendary i should definitely be able to tell a notable gimmick or ability with them and for a lot of them they just felt like a slightly stronger regular gun which is boring, it also doesnt help that they hand out legendaries like candy and all other rarities of weapon become pretty useless fast. Anyways, its a good game, a good game thats hard for me to play as such a big Borderlands 2 fan, so if you havent played the other games I think its definitely better to play those first.\n\nI would love to see better writing, more interesting vault hunters, and a better loot system for Borderlands 4, but i think with the end of BL3 directors cut that they can pull off a decent story.", "hours": 3445, "hoursAtReview": 3426, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731817363}, {"text": "Game is pretty fine, but holy fucking shit the npcs literally tell you the solution to puzzles before you've even managed to orient yourself to solve it.

I'm not going to pretend that Borderlands 1/2 were the pinnacle of game design, but they were still decent games that were enjoyable to play through. 3 is not. The base gunplay is serviceable, but theres nothing new here. Pre-sequal at least tried something different with the low grav stuff, but theres no attempt to shake up the gameplay beyond \"shoot enemy who is standing still\". Enemies all feel the same, and are dealt with in the same ways. Gun rarites are messed up, even at low levels Legendaries are too common which makes other weapons obsolete.\n\nThe writing is truly abysmal. Borderlands 1/2 certainly had lots of wacky humor, but they had enough serious stuff to prevent the tone from going complete clown fiesta. In 3 there is no \"straight man\", everyone is a clown. This could maybe be salvaged if the game truly embraced lunacy, but it does not and still tries to have a conventional plot despite not a single character inside of it taking anything seriously. Dialogue is poorly written, and there are glaring plot holes everywhere. Delivery on jokes is often poorly timed, with too much leaning on Marvel style \"WOAH THAT JUST HAPPENED\"\n\nTheres random stuff that is just poorly designed. The UX is a massive step down from Borderlands 1/2, using the map takes so many unnecessary button presses until you get to what you want. Your inventory only ever displays a small amount of items at a time which makes looking through it annoying. Manually comparing items defaults to a random item in your inventory instead of something equipped. Teammates going down has no audio/visual notification, just their status changing in the tiny bottom left of your screen. It really feels like there was no real playtesting for any of these basic UX functions that anyone competent would notice immediately.\n\nIt's a shame the gameplay is only ok and everything else is terrible, because the soundtrack is good with multiple unique battle tracks fit for each zone. There are some very good visuals, its clear a lot of effort went into certain shots to make gorgeous vistas.\n\nOverall I cannot recommend this game to anyone, I think its a downgrade from Borderlands 2 in almost every way.", "hours": 1210, "hoursAtReview": 1210, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732336037}, {"text": "i absolutely love borderlands 2 but this game has so many glaring issues i am surprised there were people who were paid to make some of these decisions, it almost feels like they were trying to sabotage the game\n\n1. sanctuary is the worst home hub i have ever used in any video game.

The graphics are good, maybe too good. (Listed 1st since that's all a lot of people seem to care about.)\n2. Gun play feels good, some guns are better than others but the majority are fairly viable.\n3. Hunting and fishing are among the best I've played a for a game where that is not its main dedication.\n4. The allied/hired NPCs aren't as dogshit as most FPS games, and in fact are quite enjoyable to have around.\n5. Big map, lost of room to explore, exploration is also fun. Counting the vehicles here too, they are good, minus the sports cars, terrible handling for them.\n\nCONS.\n1. LONG ASS CUTSCENES, several are unskippable. Brutality in cutscenes is bad.\n2. This goes along with 1., but is bad enough it deserves its own point. If you have PTSD from any form of abuse or find that to be something you dont want in a game, DO NOT CLICK \"Add to Cart!\" I know you aren't gonna listen to that but the amount of bloody and heinous torture brought back thing I never wanted to see again. I can deal with a lot, but I had to step away and have a friend tell me when some scenes where over. I can deal with a lot, but this game pulled some extremes.\n3. I finished the game. I did so without spoilers. I got 1 ending and was told of another. There is no good ending. There is no happy ending. And based on what I gathered from the discussion pages that's because the devs let their political ideals dictate how you play the game and how the ending goes regardless. If you have a moral compass you will probably be pissed.\n4. back to the cutscenes and the like, there are 9+ forced missions that occur whether you are ready or not and the game doesnt care if you are in the middle of nowhere, hiding in a bunker, or flying in the sky, each of these have cutscenes, few are skippable.\n5. Many to Most cutscenes where you're character is active takes away 90% of you move speed and remove all agency outside of \"I press W\" which is super annoying.\n6. This one is kinda relating back to 3., but you CANNOT win this game. You can complete it, but teh devs dont want you to win.\n7.

Joseph Seed's unexpected triumph, especially after a grueling playthrough on the hardest difficulty, feels like a punch to the gut. Spending 40 hours to reach an ending where the antagonist not only survives but seemingly prevails, while the player's allies perish, is frustrating. This isn't the payoff players deserve after such an investment.\n\nDespite this significant flaw, Far Cry 5 shines as an excellent hunting game, echoing the strengths of Far Cry 4 in that regard.  The weapon customization and variety are also welcome additions.\n\nWeapon accuracy and takedown execution felt partly inconsistent at times, frequently failing to register properly, even on multiple attempts.  This part inconsistency extended to the more challenging aspects of gameplay, such as capturing tankers and rescuing hostages from moving vehicles.  On several occasions, vehicles driven by AI would continue their course even after the driver was eliminated, sometimes resulting in comical, yet frustrating, crashes off cliffs.\n\nDespite these minor issues, Far Cry 5 delivers a largely positive experience.  While the AI's occasional erratic behavior\u2014such as overly-reactive startle responses or inconvenient path-blocking\u2014remains a persistent issue in the series, it doesn't significantly detract from the overall enjoyment.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like at all is the ending. \n\nOverall recommended for sure.", "hours": 2497, "hoursAtReview": 2497, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733968790}, {"text": "It's open world, you can do anything you want, as long as what you want to do is move around and target objectives with a shaky gun while the camera is a foot in front of where your face should be so it feels like you're playing the whole game looking through a tube.

The character building of Snake and how you play him really shows your connection of how you see the Big Boss of this series.\n\nMultiplayer FOB raids which was not included before in MGS series is an amazing idea, showing another \"end-game\" way of going way and beyond the simple stealth game. Building your own army, raiding others, growing stronger and FEELING the progression is truly shows that Hideo and his subordinates are masters at work.\n\nIf I go into how detailed this game is then this review would be unreadable to be honest, but you can trust me. The more you play this game the more you will realise how everything just works. Everything is catered so that you can utilise everything at your disposal. Everything has impact, depending on your usage of gadgets and it's not like RPG of course but you really can feel the environment adopting to you.\n\nSwitching Codecs to Audio Logs was a really smart idea I believe. Yes it removes some suspense but I think it still holds up. Being able to play them anywhere, whatever and whenever is a really good idea. The audio logs really give you an idea on the world and with how good the voice acting is (also the transcript) makes you want to continue to listen to them again and again.\n\nCut-scenes really make my day. It's rare compared to other MGS but damn do they feel good. I can't believe I discovered more of random ones when somebody for first time attacked my FOB (I tried FOB invasion only this year due to being a coward lol) and I can say I am always impressed by an insane \"camera work\" (which really ups the immersion and storytelling). Completing the game makes me realise I won't be able to discover some new ones and maybe that's why I am thinking of slowly giving up on doing 100% knowing that there's really nothing special about it (for me at least).\n\nWould I recommend this game? \nAbsolutely, Metal Gear Solid is a must play series for anyone who plays games. The game introduces amazing characters with plenty of personality. An introduction of amazing story which is not always go-happy, but very thought provoking. And, of course, amazing gameplay (which might of course be confusing in other MGS, but in here it feels natural and even intriguing).\n\nPlease do not pass this game, even-through its owned by KONAMI. You would be really making it a disservice. Regardless of how \"unfinished\" it is I would say it's more then enough to feel like a completed story.\n\nWhat else I can say. 386 hours and hopefully more. I can't wait for a day where I will play other Metal Gear Solid titles (playing Portable Ops on PSP now). I watched all of playthroughs but I am sure I will experience it fresh and I will enjoy my brain tingling from how dope this over-analysed (and in good sense) game plays.", "hours": 23288, "hoursAtReview": 23180, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734235006}, {"text": "DONT OVERLOOK THIS GAME IF YOU ARE ON A LOW END PC\n\nYou know this game runs like pretty damn good on my old I5 2400 gtx 1050 and its like perfect 60 all the time.\nAs long as you have some sort of graphics card.

As the final chapter in Hideo Kojima's legendary Metal Gear series, it\u2019s a game that leaves a profound impact, both for its gameplay mechanics and the deeper, more subtle themes it explores.\r\n\r\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about the world. The vast, beautiful, yet haunting landscapes of Afghanistan and Africa are meticulously crafted, and the open-world design allows players to approach missions in countless ways. Whether you\u2019re sneaking through the wilderness on horseback or calling in airstrikes to disrupt enemy convoys, the freedom to experiment is a constant thrill. The AI is intelligent, with enemies reacting realistically to the environment, forcing you to adapt your strategies. You can go stealthy or go loud, but either way, the level of control you\u2019re given over your approach is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay itself is a true testament to Kojima\u2019s vision of melding action with strategy. The game offers an intuitive and deeply satisfying combat system. Stealth is just as rewarding as direct confrontation, and each playthrough can be drastically different based on the player's preferred tactics. The level of detail in the game world is astounding\u2014things like the day-night cycle and weather conditions impact how missions unfold, making each encounter feel dynamic and alive. The introduction of the \u201cMother Base,\u201d a home base you manage and expand, adds yet another layer of depth, as you recruit soldiers and develop new technologies to aid in your war efforts.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, is where The Phantom Pain takes a more somber turn. It\u2019s a narrative filled with pain, loss, and the consequences of war. Big Boss, the central figure, is a deeply conflicted character, and the game delves into the personal and philosophical struggles of those involved in global conflict. The game explores themes of revenge, identity, and the toll of military operations, all wrapped up in the tragic fall of the protagonist. The narrative is complex and sometimes cryptic, with moments of brilliance and emotional weight that hit hard long after you\u2019ve finished the game.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most notable aspect of The Phantom Pain is its unfinished feeling. There are story threads left unresolved, especially considering the game was released in a somewhat rushed state due to Kojima's departure from Konami. This left some players with a sense of ambiguity and longing, as key plot points are left unanswered. Despite this, the game still offers an incredibly satisfying experience\u2014its gameplay, world-building, and character depth more than make up for any missing narrative closure.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack is another highlight. With a mix of melancholic original compositions and classic rock tunes from the '80s, the music mirrors the tone of the game perfectly. Tracks like \u201cSins of the Father\u201d and \u201cQuiet\u2019s Theme\u201d bring an emotional resonance to the quiet moments and action sequences alike.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a game that stands as one of the greatest achievements in modern gaming. It\u2019s a game that encourages exploration, rewards creativity, and, more than anything, offers a meditation on the complexities of war and the human condition. Kojima\u2019s penchant for storytelling, combined with the innovative gameplay mechanics, creates an experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.

I'm not going to spoil too much but it makes you feel \"invisible\". every piece of detail, music, dialogue means something\n\nFor instance, the songs \"Here's to You\" and \"The Man Who Sold the World\" both serve as hints, deepening the story's meaning.

You have to actively grow the base while developing new guns and ways of making money. \n\nThe weapon mechanics are incredibly satisfying. For instance, the durability of silencers requires you to think carefully about your choices during combat.  Should you take the risk of firing too much, knowing that your silencer could wear out? These details add depth to the gameplay, making every decision feel impactful. unless you get the rocket arm or the stun arm, but even then they're not that useful or have a cooldown.\n\ngo play the game\nmy confusing review is not enough to say how good this game is.  the game has an experience that is both rich and engaging.\n\nAlso M(edic)iller hamburger story, chef's kiss\nbut also fuck konami ", "hours": 3648, "hoursAtReview": 3169, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734057038}], "name": "METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN"}, "2977660": {"reviews": [], "name": "Cats"}, "203160": {"reviews": [{"text": "There are few games that can offer players a truly unique experience\u2014the sense of inhabiting a body. Perhaps the second [i]The Last of Us[/i], [i]Red Dead Redemption[/i], and [b]Tomb Raider[/b] stand out in this regard.\r\n\r\nMedieval historians like [i]Jacques Le Goff[/i] and [i]Alain Corbin[/i] have long examined the body from various perspectives: the body and religion, society, sexuality, medicine, play, power. Similarly, in the recent [b]Tomb Raider[/b] games, [i]Lara Croft\u2019s[/i] body tells its own story, not through overt sexualization, but through something far more intimate. The trembling of her hands as she shakes off water, the mud clinging to her skin, the way she hugs a wounded stomach, shivering from cold rain, and warming herself by the fire\u2014all this transforms her body into a powerful cultural symbol, a means of communication. The camera no longer lingers on her hips or accentuates her chest as it did in earlier iterations. Instead, in cutscenes, there is a subtle focus on her neckline, suggesting an awareness of her femininity that refuses to diminish her strength. In moments when a hostile enemy pins her to the wall, scrutinizing her vulnerable figure with predatory intent, the game communicates a striking modern message: the confrontation between masculine and feminine is played out, and the latter is revealed not as fragile but as strong, whole, and determined.\r\n\r\nLara's body now possesses a social power reminiscent of [i]Michel Foucault\u2019s[/i] ideas on the body as a site of struggle. What once was an object\u2014a body alienated from its owner\u2014has now become a symbol of autonomy and resilience. There is a visible symbiosis between spirit and physical strength. In earlier games, Lara\u2019s body did not entirely belong to her; it was subjected to the disciplinary gaze, manipulated by a series of power structures. The revival of her physicality, the integrity of the individual, is possible now because of a shift\u2014an application of what Foucault might call a technology of self-care.\r\n\r\nIn terms of stealth and combat, Tomb Raider has achieved a new level of realism. Enemies now behave with a tactical awareness, ducking behind cover, firing in short, precise bursts, and sending arrows with deadly accuracy. The game doesn\u2019t just immerse you in a world; it brings you into the flesh, the sweat, the sensation of being truly alive amidst danger, heat, and cold.\r\n\r\nThis evolution in [b]Tomb Raider[/b] isn't just about survival; it's about reclaiming identity through action and consequence. Lara\u2019s journey is a testament to resilience\u2014a physical and emotional transformation that mirrors the changes in the player\u2019s own experience. Every bruise and scar, every desperate climb and frantic scramble for cover, becomes a narrative of endurance. The landscapes she traverses, whether dense jungles or icy peaks, are not just backdrops but adversaries themselves\u2014testing her limits and demanding a raw physicality. The game\u2019s world feels alive with tension, challenging the player to read environments, anticipate threats, and make split-second decisions. In a sense, [b]Tomb Raider[/b] becomes a dialogue between the character and the landscape, between the past and the present, between who Lara was and who she is becoming. The intimacy with her body\u2014its exhaustion, pain, and strength\u2014turns every leap into a statement of defiance, a declaration that she is not only surviving but mastering a world that sought to overwhelm her.", "hours": 539, "hoursAtReview": 504, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732012017}, {"text": "Highly recommended for pretty much anyone I would say.

Some of the odd design choices remain in many of the platforming areas where from your perspective there are ledges Lara should be able to grab on but she just doesn't unless you jump from an obnoxius angle, invisible walls you hit while jumping where there shouldn't be any and a few actions Lara refuses to do unless you press the highlighted button a few times, all these issues I remember were present in the console version as well.\n\nOn the other hand the exploration and setting are great, it makes you want to wander the beaten path and see what you can find hidden in every level.

The DLC Tomb couldn't be completed because out of several burnable objects, the devs only envisioned and tested one order of burning them.\n\nThe plot is simple at best and completely transparent within the first fifth of the game, though it takes Lara until the very end to piece it together. The plotholes are numerous. Lara is captured or knocked out about five times during the game and only survives because no one bothers to put a bullet in her head and instead hang her up by her feet as a Christmas ornament. The main villain could have been killed several times during the game but wasn't for reasons unknown. General incompetence and poor judgement is a great description for all in-game characters.\n\nGameplay is the classic dumbed down RPG mechanics pioneered by Ubisoft, alongside their shopping list of meaningless collectibles. There is no single valuable skill available for unlocking and weapon upgrades just turn an already very easy combat system into something slightly easier. The only way to turn combat in this game challenging is to farm the combat achievements in a single run.\n\nOn top of that, they fumbled Lara's character hard. Even with the vision of seeing her turn into the unflappable adventurer we've known her as for a decade and a half, they failed to hit the mark by longshot. Despite all her achievements, her attitude remains that of a college student thrown straight out of her dorm into the fire as if she wasn't already an explorer with thorough survival training. Just because she's inexperienced, doesn't mean her entire personality needs to be torn down and replaced by a stereotypical white girl urbanite. The character we play as isn't Lara Croft by any stretch of the imagination. She isn't smart enough, isn't resilient enough and definitely isn't collected enough.\n\nAnd to top it all off, they took away her signature dual pistols. You only get to fire two pistols for a few seconds during a quick time event at the end. There were few ways this reboot could've been fumbled harder.\n\nI'd say play this only if you are a diehard Tomb Raider fan, but if you are, you'll be saddled with the constant feeling of everything being off from what you know to be a proper Tomb Raider game.", "hours": 1334, "hoursAtReview": 1312, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733497702}, {"text": "Wish there was a yes or no reccomendation as game seems good enough for what it is, but ran into graphics issues (NVIDIA 4090) and couldn't finish.", "hours": 970, "hoursAtReview": 931, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732386208}, {"text": "Fun for a while until you realize how insanely repetitive the game is.

I tried my hardest to keep an open mind, to support and enjoy it, and consider the rough development timeline it has suffered. However, ultimately, despite being good enough as an RPG, Veilguard is NOT a good Dragon Age game.\n\n[b] The positives: [/b]\nThe locations are visually impressive and (despite its flaws) the combat/gameplay mechanics is much more sure of itself than Inquisition or DA2, for example. The level design was overall quite engaging and some of the bigger quests, particularly the [spoiler] Siege of Weisshaupt [/spoiler] were very good.\n\nThere are however, many things that I could not look past.\n\n1) [b] The dialogue wheel[/b]. I knew this was going to be RP-lite as soon as I saw it, however this somehow manages to be worse than it was in Inquisition. In the end I felt like it didn't matter what option I picked, because Rook never said anything remotely close to what the prompt hinted at. Every time my character spoke it felt like I had zero control over who I wanted them to be.\n\n2) [b] Dialogue[/b]. Dialogue has been one of the main community-wide criticisms I have seen for this game and I have to say I agree. Voice actors sound like they've had no context for the conversation. Their intonation makes no sense and it constantly breaks my immersion. The banter has no soul and everyone speaks to each other like they're trying to make small-talk at a workplace. Rook never engages on a natural level with the companions; in fact they end up sounding like some sort of life coach. Everything feels like a guided therapy session. Example: Rook walks in on two companions arguing about their differences, Rook comes in and patronisingly explains the concept of Compromise, the companions shake hands and are now best friends. Rinse and repeat. It is like reading a children's storybook. This is becomes even more evident when the dialogue has to CONSTANTLY recap/explain what's going on as if it wasn't painfully obvious to begin with. Again, this is executed in a very unnatural way. It treats the player as if they are a child. This would be great in a childrens' game but this is supposedly M-rated.\n\n3) [b] Combat[/b]. Although the combat itself is an improvement, the skill tree is tremendously flawed. It works for the early levels - you gain new skills and get to experiment with your build. However, once you reach your specialisation, that is where the fun ends. Everything is repetitive from thereon in, and every level up feels like a chore because all you are doing is grabbing new passives to keep up with the enemies. There are no new skills to look forward to. No \"endgame build\" to work towards.\n\n4) [b] Pacing[/b]. The main quest is a solid RPG story, but I find the way it paces itself around the side-content to be a let down. There are huge end-game consequences if you don't complete the side-content. This causes the game to become a huge grind in Act 2, and lightning-speed in Act 3. I found myself getting very demotivated during Act 2, to the point where I almost lost interest completely. Then Act 3 flew by in the space of half an evening.\n\n5) [b] Races and factions[/b]. Veilguard factions do not have the same amount of content. Picking Lords of Fortune, for example, you will get almost no tie-in content or dialogue reactivity beyond constantly saying \"for gold and glory\" over and over. The balance of faction-themed items is completely off - it actually made me wonder if they ran out of time for some of them. Races are also very inconsistent in terms of lore, making it even more difficult to RP. For example, picking an elf means your Rook constantly contradicts themselves when talking about whether they're Dalish or not, their tattoos, whether they believed in the Creators or not. It all feels completely meaningless. You have no real control over who your Rook is or what their values are.\n\n6) [b] Black and white morality[/b]. One thing that I found compelling in previous instalments was the deep complexities of different factions. Are Templars good or bad? Should mages be imprisoned? In this game, no real debate is presented. The player factions are generally portrayed as \"the good guys\" despite them historically having dark sides to explore. Given that there is already no room for RP, we now can't even form our own judgement on complex lore-related issues. It is all stripped down to \"we must unite together and fight the bad guys\". Again, this feels childish and over-simplified.\n\n7) [b] The worldstate[/b]. Personally, I found it a huge shame that we could not pick at least some core decisions we made in previous games. Inquisition is not my favourite, but the reason I replayed it was because I felt like my choices mattered. I enjoyed playing around with the world I had built. With Veilguard, the choices we pick only really relate to Solas. For example, my Inquisitor never mentioned his LI, but if you romanced Solas, you get (as usual) tons of content. The politics of southern Thedas is reduced to \"the Inquisitor\" and \"everything is destroyed by the Blight\". This feels incredibly lazy and was a huge let down. I used to feel excited to read codex entries referencing things from previous games, but in this game it feels completely devoid of any respect to fans who have propped up this franchise for a decade and a half.\n\n[b] Overall[/b] I enjoyed this game while it lasted, but I doubt I will be replaying it again. For me, it goes onto the shelf with all of the other mid RPGs I have played.

As a spellblade mage I enjoyed the gameplay quite a bit. Enemy variation gets a little stale by the end of the game though.\n\nCompanions in the game are inconsequential. I enjoyed some of the companions' stories but some of them were just a grind to finish their quest line. They are highlighted buttons to press in the combat. Dialogue is sometimes fun, sometimes torture. \n\nI see no replay value since the choices don't really change the story significantly, other than the choice at the end of the game.

ALL the way through. I did ALL the background quests, side quests, faction quests, companion quests, and damn near 100% of the map-based content. I didn't skip cutscenes and dialogues because I wanted to feel like a part of the story.\n\nDo I recommend it as a sequel to the Dragon Age series? No.\nDo I recommend this as a standalone game? Also, no.\nDo I recommend this game period? Not really.\n\n\nLet's start with the good:\n- Combat is visceral, entertaining, and powerful. By far the best in the franchise and the big reason why I finished it out.\n- Leveling mechanics are solid and reminiscent of Path of Exiles with available skill trees for each of the 3 classes.\n- Items improve, meaning you can keep good stuff and tailor your kit to your specific playstyle.\n- Companions, mechanically, and their abilities help to carry fights on and allow for powerful combination moves.\n- Character generator is pretty great. Armours, while overdone at times, are cool.\n\nAnd now, the bad:\n- Armours are a bit over the top.\n- I wish I could change colour sets for my gear myself, rather than having the same six faction-based colour schemes.\n- The rest of the game. The writing, the dialog, the story, all of it.\n- No, seriously, that's it.\n\nTo preface, none of my critiques stem from the buzzword hot topics like \"Character Sexuality,\" \"IRL Political Messages,\" etc. I genuinely don't care about those. My issues come from how awful the game was in every other regard.\n\n\nThe story plays out with no serious input from the player aside from what brand of good guy they want to play: Positive, Snarky, or Gruff, with occasional opportunities to delve into Whiny, Angsty, and Angry. The companions aren't believable and their storylines are \"Rook! I need your help to kill XXX bad guy from my off-screen past that way I can succeed at saving the world!\" While the main storyline suffers from being boring, horribly predictable, and untrue to the lore built up throughout the franchise.\n\nThe writing is an insult to the players, as though the writers are afraid the audience won't understand the \"careful nuances\" of the story unless they spell it out and say it out loud a dozen or more times. The issue is, there is NO nuance. It boils down to \"Good Guys Good, Bad Guys Bad. Good Guys Stop Bad Guys.\" All of this leads to the same three-option ending from Mass Effect 3. I felt like I was being coddled and spoon-fed the plot lines every single time.\n\n\"Oh no! There's a traitor among our ranks! Who could it POSSIBLY be?! Is it: A) Your Trusted Companion Who Can Do No Wrong, B) Generic Faction NPC #35, or C) Stabby McBackStabber the Unscrupulous? Hmmmmmm, time to spend three hours doing side quests along seven parts of the story to find out who! *GASP!* It was Stabby McBackStabber the Unscrupulous the WHOLE TIME! How could we have POSSIBLY seen this coming?!\"\nThe worst part is, that's not just *one* storyline, that's about half a dozen. For those going, \"Oh yeah? Name them!\"\n1) Mayor of D'Mata's Crossing turns out to be the bad guy and, if you choose to release him, goes to the Venatori (unless you're a Warden)\n2) The Crows Part One: Illario is a Stinker.\n3) The Crows Part Two: Governor Ivenci is a Stinker.\n4) Knight Commander Lenos is in league with the Venatori. More news at 11.\n5) Gloom Howler turns out to be a Warden. Shocker.\n6) Solas is a Stinker (option dependent)\n\nMoreover, they sanitize *everything* from its moral greyness. In DA:O you link up with, among many other characters, a blatant human supremacist, an assassin with no moral scruples, a witch who killed men in the swamps, a Qunaari who confesses to having murdered an entire family because the Qun demanded, and a dwarf who... I mean. He's a Dwarf. My point is, there's plenty of \"We have to put the differences aside here to fight the greater foe.\"\n\nIn Veilguard, none of that is true.\n\n- The Necromancers (Mourn Watch) EXCLUSIVELY use willing spirits to ONLY reanimate the corpses of WILLING dead folks.\n- The Crows perform absolutely NO murders during the story that are dubious, and don't seem to ever do it for money on-screen; in fact, the ONLY mention about their murder-for-hire business is a single sidebar dialog in the Lighthouse between Davrin and Lucanis, where Davrin brings it up and Lucanis finds an easy explanation for why it's OK.\n- The Ancient Relic Thieves (Veiljumpers) aren't really \"thieves,\" they're just there to protect the woods and LEARN from the archives. All that previous story stuff about Dalish Elves murdering Humans in the Arlathan Forest in order to protect themselves due to fears of the Trail of Tea-- Sorry, the Long March? Yeahhhh, we're gonna conveniently pretend that never happened. \n- The \"Ruthless Mercenary Treasurehunters\" aren't so ruthless, for some reason. In fact, they explicitly hire a Dalish Chieftain to sort through the relics they find so they can \"rightly return them\" to the Dalish Elves instead of... Y'know, selling them for fat stacks like actual ruthless mercenaries would do.\n- The Dwarves that we meet don't believe in losing caste, or if they do then it isn't religiously enforced and they couldn't really care less.\n- Every paperboy and passerby in Minrathous knows where the Shadow Dragons' Headquarters is because they are THE worst \"underground spy network\" to EVER exist, but nothing bad ever comes of this (also Neve is awful and I wish she died from the Blight)\n\n\nIn closing, nothing about the writing, dialogue, or options therein make me feel invested into the story. It's cookie-cutter generic, it's dull, it isn't remotely thought provoking, and it's sloppily executed. But the combat is fun as hell, so I'll probably play again just for that reason.\n\nP.S.: We stan Shield Toss, Ride or Die for Davrin & Assan.", "hours": 6211, "hoursAtReview": 5595, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731808153}, {"text": "Finally finished this game. Achieved nearly all the achievements for it and got the ending I was hoping to get. I am greatly disappointed in this game. I cannot believe my beloved Dragon Age franchise did this as their grand finale. This game really tried to destroy much loved memories I had from previous titles. There were moments that shinned and at times I thought that there was hope for the game, especially early on. But then the blight really destroyed BioWares mind. Spoilers Below:\n\nCharacter Customisation:\nPOSITIVE: Great hair physics and nice to see lighting used to make sure your character looks great.\n\nNEGATIVE: As someone who enjoys as much freedom to customise your character and appreciating all the extra details, I felt so under represented with the customisation features. I like my characters being a more curvy figure to my own and I love seeing how clothing in fantasy worlds fit this aesthetic. The fact that my chest can only be a B cup is highly inappropriate and non inclusive for a game that prides itself on inclusivity. If you are going to make it fair, make customisation for everyone. The Sims even does it better.\n\nEnvironment:\nPOSITIVE: I was well crafted and every area was interesting and told the story of the location.\n\nNEGATIVE: None.\n\n\nCombat:\nPOSITIVE: The combat was excellent. I actually tired each style of class before settling on a mage. The smooth movement mixed with the wide array of spells and play styles was fantastic. All the directional icons where a bit much but you can customise that which helped with engaging more in combat. The combination work of your team to weaken or detonate an enemy brought a great element of fun and suspense in some more trying fights.\n\nNEGATIVE: I swear I have never fought so many dragons in my life. I was expecting these to be rare and a really big challenge but I finished all of them early on as their move style was exactly the same. Quite disappointing when an Ogre was tougher than a Dragon. \n\nStory:\nPOSITIVE: It was nice to see so many familiar faces... \n\nNEGATIVE: Where do I even begin. It is terrible. I couldn't even write something this bad. There is no drive with this team, there is no choice. It is a friendship simulator disguised at a Dragon Age game. I wanted to try some evil options, I wanted choices that made an actual difference and I wanted to convince or make enemies of other, choose my companions and piss off the companions I didn't like. I couldn't stand half of my team and the ones I did like were tolerable only because of how cool they could have been. There are lore elements in here that are inconsistent to other games and character morals that we have witnessed in other games complete ruined by incompetent writing. I almost punched my monitor when Morrigan started telling me her 'changed' outlook on life and her 'new' story (PS: WHERE IS HER SON?). Everything I loved in the prior games was destroyed by terrible writing and all they had to do to fix it was not force us to hate Solas (Leave Solas Alone :P). If you love Dragon Age lore and the story so far, just skip this. \n\nRomance:\nPOSITIVE: At least there was romance in this game.\n\nNEGATIVE: I don't think the writers know what romance and suspense is. They nailed it in the other games. You build up admiration with another character through flirting (some of that was so badly written in DAV that I didn't believe it was even flirting), to then have a moment of confession (which usually happened on a date or during a fight), then there is 'passion' (secret meetings, snog sessions and more dates) and then a sweeping kiss or intimate scene before a big fight and finally an 'I love you' before a final fight. THIS GAME, it was flirt with everyone then confession (I romanced Lucanis and my confession was over him cooking me food - no actual confirmation of a confession) then sleep together... no 'I like you', first kiss, date or anything like that. There was no suspense and when they FINALLY hinted at a kiss it just ended and NEVER happened again. My first kiss with the person I was in a relationship with in game was just before the only intimate scene in game. The 'I love you' meant nothing as I felt like Rook was taken advantage of.\n\nSOLAS:\nMy final comment is in regards to Solas. I romanced him when I first played DAI. I loved his story, I liked how he almost fell to the Inquisitor and in the DLC I was so excited to see what he would do. The fact that this game was trying to force me to hate him, loath him and even kill him made me angry. It was as if everything we learnt about him in DAI was ignored and he was just another elven god trying to destroy the world. There is even a moment in game where Rook states that she must kill Solas before killing the last boss. I sat there going 'Hes got the same goal as you, why the hell would you do that. Use him then decide what to do.' I, as a player, shouldn't be thinking that. If you play this game without any love for Solas it would be an easy story to tell. But man the writers tried hard to convince you otherwise and contradicted themselves while trying to do it. \n\nCONCLUSION:\nDAV was a game I am glad I played. But I wish it was the game it should of been. I finished it to finish the story of Solas. But my score went from a hopeful 7/10 at the start when I saw glimpses of potential that I was so desperate for. To finish the game with a 3/10. I am so frustrated with not only BioWare but their incompetent writers that ruined such an beloved story for their own greed.

I've always loved the Dragon Age franchise, this game butchered the world. They culled it of culture and controversy. They erased slavery, racism, moral dilemma, and choice. Struggle can not be represented without portraying struggle. A grim world I loved that called out the evils of the real world has been made into a happy-go-lucky game that above all else, doesn't want you to question your morals. I cried tears of joy over how real talking to companions in Inquisition felt. This game contains none of the merits of it's predecessors. They took an evil organization that buys and abuses enslaved children, then murders anyone who tries to leave, and decided to portray it as a friendly family of assassins loved by all. There's more depth in the datamined character description of my least favorite character than any part of the actual game. Your character is everyone's therapist, an underdog saving the world while alerting no global power or significant organization to the threat, whose only goal in life is to kill the obvious bad guys who are motivated only by evilness and power. There is no room for freedom of choice or deep conversation. They purged any hopes of that from the game so long ago that the remnants of what we could have had do not remain.", "hours": 3135, "hoursAtReview": 3135, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732050264}, {"text": "Below is my review after 100% finished game. Although I cannot recommend the the game as a new addition to the DA franchise, which are dark fantasy rpg games with heavy reliance on choice, I must say that I am not sorry that I played it as it is a decent 6/10 action adventure game situated in the DA/Thedas universe. \n\n- The story:\nThe story is good, but it is hindered by bad writing, especially in the abyssimal first third of the game where everyone is cheery in situations where it is not appropriate and explaining everything to you like you are a child. All missions at that time feel off, noone is in a hurry, you take walks to buy food and other stuff, talk about insignificant things etc. It does get better afterwards, with the last third being the strongest. I especially enjoyed the missions related to the grey wardens and Solas. We also get to fight some dragons. \nThankfully, there are no fetch side quests. Some of the side quests are simply fighting, but this is still better than collecting shards and chasing goats like in DAI.\n\n- No continuity from previous games:\nThe biggest player choices in the DA games would affect events across the games and Inquisition promised far reaching consequences with its war table and ordinary missions affecting multiple kingdoms and groups.\nHowever, the DAV team decided to just cross out all of that and make some canon version of the events that suits them without any care for consistency with previous games and player choices in them.\nThe returning characters are simply different people under the same name \u2013 all of them have been changed to look very differently and, what is most important, they are not the same personality.\n\n- The character design does not fit the setting:\nsome of the characters are too cartoonish (disney style) and with the voices to fit that cartoon look. This, combined with the cheery remarks, kills immersion in what should have been a dark medieval fantasy world at the brink of extinsion. Also, sometimes Rook and other characters smile when it does not fit the scene.\n\n- Lack of choice and a world filtered of anything that can be considered morally gray or bad is the greatest problem of this game:\nAll factions are unrealistically good - good Crow assassins that never kill innocents, good Lords of Fortune looters who do not steal and have advisor to tell them to return culturally significant artefacts. Isabella, their leader and returning character who used to be free spirited, proud and charming, but also selfish, a thief and a liar \u2013 now makes push ups because she misgendered someone.  \nYour character Rook is almost predefined, you can select how they look and their faction, but you cannot actually shape their personality (and the overall story as well). When we select a faction, we are given an origin story - we have no choice in that story, we are always the good person who saved innocents. It would have been much better to get an origin story mission and make our own choices (or even select from several written ones in the character selection screen) - e.g. if I am crow, I may have chosen to be ruthless rather than benevolent savior. There are no faction specific missions for Rook as well, making him/her like a junior errand boy/girl for his/her companions's missions. \nThis lack of choice continues throughout the game. We have mostly cosmetic choices where we basically say the same thing, but with different tone.  Even worse, the companions just call you, blurt out something that they need which results in a side mission and your character just automatically agrees. You cannot refuse a mission, you cannot kick out a character, you cannot even disagree with their view \u2013 you can only support them and say what the devs have decided.\n\n- Interactions with characters and romance:\nThe interactions in the first third of the game are weakest again (collecting berries, talking to innanimate objects and other stupidities), but if you push through, then the stories and the characters themselves become much more interesting. I especially liked Emmrich and Bellara's stories.\nRomance is mediocre and not a big part of the game overall. You have several scripted scenes mostly towards the end of the game and no special interactions (even ability to talk more with that character). Also, they have avoided any conflict when you try to romance several people - this is unrealistic and makes romances feel very meaningless. Early flirting with many characters is ok, but I reached with two characters a point where they express strong feelings, I locked in with one of them and the other never even acknowledged that, as if someone erased their memory and nothing happened.\nRook is largely ignored outside of the predefined cutscenes with companions. You see two of them talking, you come close, they finish their conversation and start looking at you silently like an imposter (they could at least greet you, better yet - include you). If you visit their room, they brush you off. You have no chance to talk to them, ask questions or anything. So I simply gave up and do not interact unless specifically called for.\n\n- Diversity:\nBioware have always been on the forefront when it comes to diveristy and have created some of the best characters across ME and DA games. DAV is not much different, having mostly well fitting diverse characters. However, as there were some heated discussions on \"wokeness\" that could needlessly prevent someone from buying the game, I decided to pay special attention to that - these several scenes with Taash are very small part (maybe less than 1%) of the game and blown way out of proportion. For me, the biggest problem is that the character is written poorly as a teenager personality instead of a grown person, that the writers are using contemporary terms that do not fit and, as with everything else, that you do not have a choice on how to react.  \n\n- Gameplay\nAlthough I do not like action style fighting and would have preferred tactical combat, this one is not too bad. It lacks any variety, however, and gets very repetitive. You basically click the same 2-3 buttons all the time.\nThey have basically destryed party combat - only two companions and they do not take damage and are immportal. If you are a warrior, you do not have a reason to jump and save your mage and, on the other hand, if you are the mage the enemies will still target mostly you. \nThe game is riddled with small puzzles everywhere - they are simple, but the sheer quantity is annoying, especially in the beginning when the maps feel like labyrinths where you solve many puzzles to find a way to move forward. Once you unlock more locations and teleports it is not so bad.\n\nCrafting and equipment:\nYou can no longer craft, but only upgrade and enchant equipment. While this is not such a big issue for me, the fact that the equipment is tied to a specific character is. I can have multiple perfect rings or armour and I cannot equip it on my companions. I have to search for ones that are labeled for them.", "hours": 5642, "hoursAtReview": 5642, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731865106}, {"text": "Never in my life I had been so disappointed with a game. Before anyone tries to pull the card that I am blinded by the nostalgia of the previous games, I had finished only Inquisition and only a few months ago. There is no nostalgia influencing my disappointment over the game \u2014 it's the game itself that is as bad as it was possible.\n\n10 years of development and nothing had been done right; graphics, sure, this game is incredibly aesthetically pleasing, the most beautiful I've seen so far. Combat was entertaining. And that's where the positives end. \n\nThis game is a disgrace to the fans, to the lore, and to previous creators of the Dragon Age. There is no logic in their actions, rejecting their own lore and creating something new that has no roots, no connection to anything. The childish behaviour of the main characters \u2014 I'm speaking of Neve and Lucanis \u2014 throwing a fuss over Rook not going to save their city; i ask how one person is supposed to change anything, if whole team couldn't. The fact that support had been turned off after hardening gives me off the vibes of \"You didn't play like I wanted you to do it, so no matter if we're fighting against the Evanuris that can destroy the world, I'll not heal you in the battle, go die for all I care\". The reactions are childish and plain stupid. Not to mention apparently Minrathus relies only on Shadow Dragons? Where are the rest that were helping in previous games? Are they all not there, when it's needed? It's unlogical and ridiculous. \n\nCompanion's depth of character matches the lid of the pot. They are boring, unmemorable and sometimes even irritating in their lack of rationality. Taash is a crime against non-binary people, and I'm saying it as non-binary person themselves \u2014 this had potential, yet they had messed up so badly I only cringe when i see Taash. That growling made me physically sick. Bellara is irritating for most of the part, I had to skip her dialogue to not get headache. Neve is even more infuriating, I can't stand her. Lucanis is a huge disappointment after the hype he had received, I feel like he's a poor copy of Zevran. Emmrich, Davrin and Harding are so far the best of the main companions, I enjoyed their quests and never skipped anything. Still, the most interesting characters remain (to me): Myrna, Vorgoth, Viper, Viago and Thea. Give me more of them, and I'll be happy. \n\nRomance. Hm, non-existent is the best word when I have to speak of Lucanis' one. Spite is cool, I like him, overall romance is buggy, boring and basically have no cutsecens. Merely one kiss and that's it. He was supposed to be steamy and awkward, the only steam that was there was mine caused by the headache I had when I realized how scammed we had been. \n\nCharacters are crystal clear, all have such good hearts, all wants to be saviours and all are oh so kissy. There's no morally grey characters here, there's no realizing. It's all sweet and fluffy that mere thought is making me feel sick. I never thought I'd miss my most hated characters in the Inquisition, but Sera and Vivienne at least had personality and stood up by their believes \u2014 no matter how it irritated me to be in the same room with them. They felt real. No one in Veilguard feels real \u2014 more like being taken straight from the fairytale for the children. \n\nThe fact we are to choose between Davrin or Harding and we cannot save them is ridiculous. Harding quite literally is has power of Titans, yet she used arrows against Ghilan'nain \u2014 the most irrational decision, the developers just wanted to kill someone off no matter how ridiculous it'd be. They nerfed Harding and her power. Did I mention before they go against their own lore? \n\nInquisitor. Solas. I was so excited to see them, and i saw them for exactly 3 minutes and 23 seconds. I believe that's the count. Was it touching? A little, because I was rooting for them. But there's not enough, it was hyped and again \u2014 fans were scammed. I read fanfics longer than that and made chats in Character.ai with better storyline for them than Bioware did. I don't know whether to laugh or cry at this point. Solas was amazing, as he always is, even if he had fallen to Disney-like vibes slightly as well.\n\nCharacters creator would be good if women were allowed to look like women. No breasts, build like a brick. My mother said they look Neanderthal. And she's correct about that one. Is being femme a crime to Bioware? Does the woman need to look and walk like a man so that she can be powerful? This game was supposed to be inclusive, why were women who are more curvy excluded from it? Is Bioware considering their bodies too sexual? Well, oversexualizing them is their problem. Those people deserve representation as well, especially since the company wants to be oh so open to everyone. \n\nEndgame is good. I enjoyed it. Not as thrilling as I expected, with only one twist that I should've expected and the fact I didn't only shows how impatient I was to finish this damned game and uninstall it. \n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. Maybe new fan that doesn't know the lore and won't have to be disappointed at every minute spent in this game. Literal children could play it, there's nothing they haven't seen already considering nowadays medias. And it feel like they were the target group of this \u2014 not adults, considering how naive that game is. I enjoyed first 20h of the game, the rest of it was a struggle to push through and I had to force myself. The happiness I felt when I could finally uninstall this game is unmeasurable. \n\n5/10 for me. \n\nI'm going back to the Inquisition to enjoy some real gaming and writing.", "hours": 5167, "hoursAtReview": 5167, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731765540}, {"text": "10 years ago, I played Dragon Age Inquisition for the first time and completely fell in love with the entire series. I went back and played the other two games multiple times, read the lore and additional comics, made several world states in the Dragon Age keep, carefully and thoughtfully building my ideal story so that when Dreadwolf finally came and I could lead my beloved characters and this full, beautiful world into a finale worthy of it. You can imagine my disappointment.\n\nDragon Age: Veilguard feels like a game catered to a different audience entirely. I still cannot believe it belongs to the same game series and world I fell in love with. To put it into perspective, Dragon Age: Inquisition ends on a cliffhanger that suggests a cultural revolution and uprising from the elves leaving to join forces with Solas and his armies. It leaves both the sunburst and andrastian chantry shocked, horrified and angry at Solas' claims to disprove their entire religion and taking up arms for it. Tevinter, at the heart of it all, losing control of both their religious following in the crisis of faith and the elves they've enslaved, all with the Qunari knocking harder on their doorstep. The Inquisition is left either a powerful but corrupt organization with a massive army and no direction, or a small group of friends with few resources and weak efforts; all this in addition to the storyline that followed us through every game before this, the Circle mages finally rebelling against the Templars, causing tensions to be higher than they've ever been on a scale much bigger than Kirkwall in Dragon age 2 and sending the chantry into more discord, leaving the divine you've chosen to frantically pick up the pieces. This was our setup into this game.\n\nI was on the edge of my seat, particularly with the state of the world now, thinking at least I can fight my battles in Dragon Age and tackle this representation of very real issues to help me process the horrors we are seeing politically today. I don't know how to express how much this game meant to me, and so to play through it and discover that all of the lore and relevance and meaning that I had been anticipating not only wasn't there, but was actively dismissed the moment they asked me to set minimize my entire world state into 2 of maybe the least important questions (I love solas don't get me wrong but holy shit there was so much more) : whether or not the inquisition was disbanded (not even for story purposes around corruption or anything like the reasons said in the third game, but simply for a single sentence the inquisitor says) and whether or not I wanted to redeem Solas.\n\nI couldn't believe the disrespect for the long term fans of the game in the interest of a much simpler and bland setting full of characters with two or three personality traits each, poorly written and frankly jarring dialogue choices, the loss of tactical camera for a more trendy and oversimplified combat and loot system (though I will admit this is more personal preference and the pacing of the combat system was actually an improvement in some ways despite being a disappointment in others), and the loss of such impactful, empathetic, captivating and personal relationships reduced to a handful of romantic encounters and surface-level problems that not only are severely lacking in content and perspective but feel reminiscent of scrambling to get teenagers to work together for their last minute dnd game.\n\nAnd, on an even more personal note, I feel personally scorned as a trans person playing this game. I was at first delighted to discover that my community would have representation and the option to be trans and have a variety of LGBTQ+ representation in the game to look forward to. What I did not expect was to see a childish brat who quite literally spits in their mother's face for not understanding them immediately, undermining all the effort and pain that many queer people endure to keep their families and help them understand their queerness. Taash has no respect or empathy for others, and their arguments for queerness feel like watching the plot of heartstopper catered at pre-teens suddenly thrust in the middle of a 15 year old dark fantasy franchise. Taash is a disrespectful and harmful interpretation of a very lovely and important community that has only given grounds for conservative bigots to hate on our community more. It is a gross oversimplification of queer struggles, and frankly I have no idea why they couldn't just give us representation without having to attend a therapy session between what is supposed to be a grown person and their mother that we cannot even express our disapproval or discomfort with in the game. It makes me sad to think back on that beautiful scene with Dorian and his father in Inquisition, where the word gay isn't even mentioned or really relevant, it's just a fact of his reality and his reconciliation with his father is something all people, not just the queer community could relate to. It was a storyline that honored the existence and difficulties of queerness while acknowledging that although it is relevant and does matter, who the fuck cares, and how is it your business? Knowing that Bioware had done and could have done it right again instead of what we got broke my heart.\n\nI understand that there is a lot of pressure, time, money, and work to come out with a game founded on such tangled webs and what if's depending on whether or not the player experienced the previous games, but I firmly believe that Veilguard could have set itself up for success with a short animated sequence in game to catch players up and let them choose their world state right there; if they had prioritized the love and respect of the world and its art over fitting into current trends, I can now only imagine what could have been--I would have taken so much over what we got, but alas.\n\nI have so much more to say and so many grievences to air, but these are the ones I felt were most important to share and hopefully will save someone $60.\n\nTLDR: if you are a long term fan of the Dragon Age franchise and love the lore, I would not recommend this game, and I instead would encourage you to save yourself the time and money, and go back and play the games we know and love.\n\nIf you're new here, and you just want a simple RPG, I still wouldn't recommend it, because it's $60 and 70 hours minimum for a whole lot of \"meh\".

The romances are minimal, there's extremely little content.\nThe Player Character is a hand-for-hire without any personal stakes in what is happening. There is no real roleplaying aspect - you can be nice, nice-with-a-joke or stern-nice. You can never disagree with someone or tell them they're wrong. And: you have a companion from your faction that is ALWAYS more important than you for that faction. Your character doesn't really matter to the story.\n\nBut most importantly, the story has been filed down to absolute shallowness. It\u2019s pumped so full of flavour without substance, all edges have been smoothed over until there\u2019s nothing left of conflict and friction and ANYTHING that could be a tiny bit controversial that it feels\u2026 hollow. There are factions that are utterly useless and have zero content, and others that SHOULD have content are ignored (Lords of Fortune vs. Dwarves. Seriously. KAL-SHIROK?! Why wasn't that a faction?!?). There are such interesting story bits in side quests and companion quests, but none have consequences, none have depth (looking at dwarven magic, a Forgotten One, rogue Qunari, a demon possession, political upheaval in Tevinter...). \n\nNothing from the old games matters. The more lore you know, the harder it is to play this game. They completely erase Thedas from the map in LETTERS your character may or may not read. Finally we see Tevinter - except we see nothing of Tevinter or even hints of what we know of the land. No slavery, no blood magic - except for the faceless bad Venatori, of course. Finally we see the Crows - except we see nothing of what Zevran fought against and tried to dismantle. Instead we have a benevolent mafia (???). Finally, we see Dalish that are actually adept at handling their story - and then they kick that around with a conversation where they speculate that maybe humans were right to treat them like they did.\n\nThere's more, but this is long already.

The game completely erases everything that made the Dragon Age universe interesting. Racial tensions? Gone. You can still play as elves and Qunari, but don\u2019t worry, their history and struggle won\u2019t be weighing you down. Slavery? Meh, doesn\u2019t matter anymore. The deep complexities of a world where elves are oppressed and Qunari are locked in centuries of war? Apparently, those were just too complicated for this Disney game, so we\u2019ll just toss them out the window. Pick your race, get a tiny bit of unique dialogue and move on. \n\nGone are the days when [u]your decisions[/u] in previous Dragon Age games actually mattered. The impact of past choices? Sorry not here. The world of Veilguard feels so disconnected \u2014like it\u2019s trying to be a Dragon Age game but not really bothering to remember what came before it. Decisions you made in 1, 2 AND Inquisition \u2014where the MAIN VILLAIN of Veilguard came from? Well, forget about them, because none of that is relevant now. The game\u2019s world-building is just a vague outline of the Dragon Age universe with no respect for the rich history of the series.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget [u]the dialogue system[/u]. It\u2019s basically a choose-your-own-adventure but none of the choices matter. You get a dialogue wheel that lets you pick responses that have absolutely nothing to do with what your character actually says. It\u2019s a masterclass in not letting you make meaningful choices. Oh, and the voice acting? Think of it like a motivational speaker giving a TED talk\u2014flat, lifeless, and completely lacking in emotional depth. The banter between companions? Let\u2019s just say you\u2019ll be begging for a little awkward silence after the 50th pep talk with toxic positivity. \n\n[u]The pacing[/u] is... something. Act 2 is a marathon of side content, designed to grind you down until you start questioning all your life choices. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re playing a game made by someone who\u2019s read a book about RPGs but never actually played one. You\u2019ll hear your companions repeat what you just saw in case your brain stopped working for five seconds.

However, Inquisition had opted to go for a hyper-realistic aesthetic, while Veilguard goes for a very artistic look with gorgeous environments. I personally feel that is much more suitable for a fantasy game.\n\n2. The combat of Veilguard can be hit or miss, but from what I have seen, the majority of players seem to love the fast pace. It can definitely feel more engaging and responsive than previous entries. The difficulty curve is very fair. I personally find it enjoyable enough, though it\u2019s not my favorite. I prefer having an actual quickbar with a number of different abilities and not just be limited to only 3 at a time.\n\n3. Veilguard lacks the kind of simple unimaginative fetch quests that often plague RPGs, which was a problem with Inquisition. Side quests are fewer but they are a lot more fleshed out, and often unlock new areas to explore. The companion and faction quests actually have an impact in the endgame, much like the loyalty quests of Mass Effect 2, and you would probably be penalized for ignoring them.\n\n4. Just like any BioWare game the companions are, for the most part, very well written characters with a surprising amount of depth. From the trailers, I had expected to hate Emmrich but he ended up being one of the most wholesome companions BioWare had ever written. There has been a lot of criticism regarding Taash, but they also grow on you very soon. With their unique personalities and meaningful personal arcs, the companions are probably the most memorable part of the game.\n\n5. The companions had excellent voice acting as well, as did most of the NPCs. Whether it\u2019s Neve\u2019s iconic drawl, Bellara\u2019s fast, energetic speech, Emmrich\u2019s warm, polite, properly enunciated words, or even Taash\u2019s non-committal grunts, each actor really brought their character to life.\n\n6. Since the maps are full of secrets and gathering loot is the main way of acquiring and updating new equipment, the exploration feels very rewarding. If you are a completionist like me, you will probably spend quite a bit of time figuring out hidden ways and puzzles that lead to the next chest, and when you do, it definitely feels worth it.\n\n[h2]The Bad:[/h2]\n\n1. The writing of the game is extremely inconsistent. Some quests, especially those involving companions or factions, do feel very much like the old BioWare magic. Then you come across some dialog that seems like it was written by a teenage fanfiction author, especially during the first half of the game. Some dialog options made no sense. The witty options often sounded less humorous than the serious ones. Sometimes the usage of certain words feels anachronistic. I guess this was to be expected after letting go of your most experienced writers halfway through development.\n\n2. While the animation overall is excellent, I had no idea what was wrong with Rook\u2019s facial expressions. Often, even during serious discussions regarding death or loss, his face would break out in a smile. This was very unnerving.\n\n3. Though BioWare has not actually broken any existing lore, they [i]have[/i] been too liberal with it, which may cheapen the significance of some of the previous events. While the main storyline is more interesting than Inquisition, I feel like they tried to overcompensate with lore dumping and shock value. Veilguard gives you a LOT more information about the world, the Fade, and its history than all three previous games combined, and the worst part is that as players, you don\u2019t find out these secrets organically like the previous games, but through \u2018memories\u2019 that you discover. This again seems like poor writing. I could do without a history lesson with a PowerPoint presentation in the middle of my game.\n\n4. Veilguard is the least optimized game BioWare has ever made. Until now their PC releases were excellent. Mass Effect 2, 3, even Dragon Age Inquisition offered a great performance, but even if you exceed the recommended requirements of this game, you would run into FPS drops, stuttering, and graphical glitches, especially in crowded areas.\n\n5. The Dragon Age series was being simplified ever since Origins. DA2 took away talents, Inquisition simplified skill trees and attributes, and Veilguard does away with the illusion entirely. It is now an action-RPG with a lot more focus on the action. You have less active companions, who have been reduced to background characters in combat, and you don\u2019t even need to have a proper party with a tank and healer. BioWare seems to have bought into the myth that people want easier and simpler games, or that players don\u2019t like to think too much. This is factually wrong, and honestly kind of insulting.\n\n6. The lack of references from choices made in previous games was quite disappointing. Regular players would have been satisfied with some passing mentions and a few codex entries. These exist, but since the game doesn\u2019t really import any choices, they feel very generic. What\u2019s worse is that at times the game tries to subtly imply certain previous choices as canon while they continue to claim that a canon does not exist.\n\n7. After the powerful last act, the epilogue was very disappointing. The ending slides just repeat what we already know, with no indication of how those decisions would change things in the world further down the line.\n\n[h2]The Others:[/h2]\n\n1. I felt somewhat disappointed that while the plot of Veilguard deals with an even bigger world ending threat, it doesn\u2019t feel as [i]epic[/i] as Inquisition. This has nothing to do with the maps being linear. Origins itself felt very epic, as did Mass Effect 2 and 3. There is just something inexplicable missing in this game that couldn\u2019t make me care that much about the end of the world. The soundtrack definitely did not help in this regard.\n\n2. I have heard the criticism that Veilguard is not as dark as the previous entries and the game has been \u2018Disney-fied\u2019. Both these allegations are false. In many ways, Veilguard is the darkest Dragon Age entry, and you will not come out of it emotionally unscathed.\n\n3. Despite the claims that the game is too \u2018woke\u2019 (whatever that means), I have not seen much discussions about gender and sexuality outside  one codex entry and a few personal quests for Taash, which might amount to 10 minutes of dialog in an easily 90 hour game. If that offends you too much, you may need some self-reflection. Thedas has always been a very progressive setting and Veilguard just continues that tradition.\n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\n\nThe Veilguard is a good game. It has a lot of life. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a great Dragon Age game. To me, it\u2019s definitely the weakest in the series in terms of writing, but it is not without its own strengths. Much like the Dread Wolf himself, Veilguard tries to be a rebel, but I don\u2019t know if the rebellion was necessary at all.\n\nVeilguard makes me think that I should adjust my expectations for the future of the series and be ready for more unnecessary simplifications, because some executives somewhere in EA headquarters think that players want to think less and have more flashy action. I guess these are just the times we live in now.\n\nFinal verdict: 6.5-07 / 10", "hours": 11023, "hoursAtReview": 11022, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731988343}, {"text": "Its pretty good if you skip all dialogue and character scenes, mute the voice audio while traveling and only focus on combat and interactions with Solas.  I've never played a Dragon Age or rpg that made me dislike companions more than this game. Game-play out in the world is fun, environments are grand at times. The cartoonish design in visuals and personalities of characters is just disappointing and at times infuriating.  It does not meet expectations for a game titled Dragon Age.", "hours": 8931, "hoursAtReview": 8868, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732155310}, {"text": "Is it a bad game? No\nIs it the best Dragon Age game? No\n\nThe game is definitely not as bad as people are making it out to be. However, as a huge Dragon Age fan, it is impossible not to compare to previous games. There are both pros and cons. \n\nThe writing is unfortunately the worst in a Dragon Age game. It's not horrible, but it's not good. There are also strong points, especially near the end of the main storyline.\n\nThe bloat of Inquisition is gone, in favor of few and better quests that don't take too long to complete, which is a win in my book. Exploration is also tight and fun, unlike the huge empty maps of Inquisition. Overall I definitely prefer this map and quest setup. \n\nCompanions are likeable like every dragon age game. Do they top favorites such as Dorian or Alistair? Of course not. But they're fine. \n\nRomances so far have been a huge letdown. I romanced Davrin my first playthrough and I thought 'wow, that's very little content'. Now on my second playthrough romancing Lucanis and apparently, it can get worse. When there IS romance content, it's good. However, there is just so LITTLE of it compared to previous Dragon Age games. It's really a huge disappointment. I hear Emmrich is pretty much the only one who has proper romance content (why they did not give everyone an equal amount of scenes is also frustrating), and I regret not romancing him from the getgo to get the best experience. \n\nAnother thing I don't like, and this is coming from a NB person, is the very modern terms and dialogue. In past dragon age games you had characters like Dorian and Krem, but they didn't say the terms 'trans' and 'gay'. It was still very clear what they were, and not saying it did not hurt their storyline. Suddenly hearing dragon age characters say 'trans' and 'nonbinary' throws me off. I wish they presented it like Dorian in inquisition. \n\nThere is also no way to be evil in this game, something I reserve for second playthroughs. There is simply no dialogue option that is even remotely rude or evil. You are always a set nice character. It hurts replayability. Yes there are certain choices that change big things in the game, but the majority of the game will still be playing as the same character as your previous playthrough. A shame. \n\nCombat is the best that Dragon Age games have ever had. Thinking of going back to Inquisiton with the combat it has makes me miss DATV's combat already. But you don't play Dragon Age for the combat anyway. \n\nOverall, it was a good time. I don't see myself playing it as much as previous dragon age games. There's just not much reason to. I am planning 3 playthroughs to play as all classes, play as the romances I want, do all endings, and that's it. The different factions and races don't provide enough content to excuse more playthroughs. But still, I repeat, it is not as bad as people are making it out to be, especially people that have not touched the game in the first place.\n\nEdit: Oh, also want to add, that despite the game looking wonderful and running great, I get random crashes that say that my 3060 was 'physically removed'. I've seen other players having this error. It's very frustrating and happens every 1,5 hours usually.

I have played 80 hours of Veilguard at the time of review.\r\n\r\nVeilguard is a 4/10 game.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing wrong with the plot points of the story - the true catastrophe lies in the script. Where Dragon Age once pushed boundaries and was unafraid to feature negativity, both in its subject matter and its characters, it has now been sanitised. The characters all act as if they have HR looming over their shoulder, ready to sanction them if they step out of line or say something the rest of the cast disagree with. Gone are the days of complex dynamics like the one between Fenris, Merrill, and Anders, or between Morrigan and Alistair, or between Vivienne and Solas. These are the times of the yes-men.\r\n\r\nThe lack of imported worldstates hamstrings this game. It's funny that this is the game that was supposed to be named after Solas because it is actually very soulless. The removal of imported worldstates is a giant middle finger to everyone who played the series all the way through from the very beginning. Imported Worldstates were the ONLY thing BioWare RPGs had over other games in the genre - the sole innovation the studio has come up with in the last twenty years - and now they're gone, and all we're left with is that fucking dialogue wheel that never says what it means. \r\n\r\nIf the person who wrote the \"Humorous\" dialogue options for Rook reads this, please DM me - I'm happy to pay for some comedy classes, because Jesus Christ, you're in urgent need.\r\n\r\nThe craziest thing is that the combat is actually great. It's genuinely fantastic, and that's what horrifies me the most, because I've found myself thinking that the dreaded live service version of this game that the studio was originally going for might've actually been the better game.\r\n\r\nI was going to give the game a 5/10 and call it average, but I realised a 5/10 game wouldn't infuriate me this much. I wouldn't be this annoyed and this disappointed.\r\n\r\nThis is the most disappointing game I have ever played.", "hours": 5832, "hoursAtReview": 4956, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1731855618}, {"text": "[h1] This game could've been magical [/h1]\n\n[b] Fuck the woke discourse and all the LGBT drama, i don't care about that crap and whatever other shit people say to argue against whatever hidden agenda exist... [/b]\n\nTalking about serious stuff here. \n\nMany people dislike Dragon Age Inquisition, and that is understandable, after all most of Dragon Age fans started at Origins. But Dragon Age Inquisition managed to add many, and i mean MANY very interesting lore stuff while also making it look very epic.\n\nFor example, Corypheus, being just a random angry magister, has one of the best introductions from any game ever, with deep written dialogue and god-like soundtrack. It also managed to introduce a lot of lore about the elven phanteon while keeping most of the interesting things a mystery.\n\nThe stakes from Inquisition, even being way smaller than Veilguard, feel vastly superior and worrying.\n\n[h3] What does that have to do with Veilguard? [/h3]\n\nThis game puts you up against beings thousands of years old, literal gods and their archdemons who have been hyped up as the main villains of the franchise for so long. Giant dragon killing machines spreading terror and destruction in their wake for hundreds of years.\n\nAnd yet with all these threats and villains, the game fails to convey how big the stakes are. The elven gods and archdemons showed in Veilguard feel like Disney or Power Ranger villains, with literal cringe dialogues like \"Im evil and im going to win, you can't possibly win against me, i'm a god\", \"I'm immortal while my archdemon lives\" (casually tells how to win against him). Comparing this to dialogues like we've seen from the Architect, Loghain or Corypheus, it feels like a damn joke...\n\nAlso the soundtrack from Veilguard is horrible, there isn't a single song i can say from this album, in contrast with Inquistion that had so many great tracks such as : Journey to Skyhold, Lost Temple, Lost Elf, Wester Approach ambience and Hinterlands ambience, The Descent, In Hushed Whispers, Eluvian Battle Suite, Eluvian Crossroads and Viddassala, i could go on and on but these are the ones i remember from memory.\n\nI'm not going to talk about gameplay because we all know that Dragon Age has never had an identity in terms of gameplay. Every game is unique and Veilguard wouldn't be any different in that regard... But what i can say is that the gameplay is fun and the classes are built in a way skills feel very fun to combo during combat.\n\nGraphics are good to look at, definitely a step up from Inquisition, face animations are cool as well, not like ME Andromeda. If Dragon Age 5 ever exists, i hope they go back to the epicness of Origins and Inquisition, because this game just ain't it.\n\nIf you're a DA fan and want to know how the story ends, go for it on sale, because it concludes a LOOOOOT of lore points presented in earlier games, and opens up the doors for what's next in DA universe (Which i thought was very cool since it's been teased since DAI)\n\nOne more thing, the decision to only carry 3 options is absurd and it shouldn't have been like that. Even those 3 options you choose feel very useless during the game. For a franchise with so many events this was the worst choice they made, this also might be one of the main reasons Veilguard failed to convey how serious it is in story terms...", "hours": 8296, "hoursAtReview": 8296, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732733632}], "name": "Dragon Age\u2122: The Veilguard"}, "289130": {"reviews": [{"text": "A pretty good game - I find it to be well balanced with unique factions who all feel very distinct from one-another.

Not really a fan of half naked girls fighting demon hordes and squirming while casting spells HOWEVER there's tons of really badass skins for your character. I just don't like going too outside of the fantasy (bikinis, alluring outfits).\n\n- Gender lock of most classes: there's very few exception on this (Striker being male of Martial artists, Gunslinger being female of Gunners). \n\n- Not all classes from KR/RU will be available from the start in EU/NA, which will come at a later date.

[/b]Truly, cash shop abusers will get the better from competitive and speedrunning content, but if you're willing to partecipate in Guilds and play as a team, no one should be scared.

Non sono un grande fan delle donne mezze nude che squittiscono mentre si combatte orde di demoni, pero' devo anche dire che ci sono un sacco di skin veramente belle con cui vestire i personaggi. Semplicemente non mi piacciono i giochi fantasy dove puoi (volendo) andare in giro in mutande o in bikini, per quanto mi riguarda rovina l'atmosfera.\n\n- Gender lock per quasi tutte le classi (eccezione per lo Striker, maschio dei Martial artists e per la Gunslinger, femmina dei Gunner)\n\n- Non tutte le classi disponibili nei server RU/KR saranno disponibili all'inizio, verranno introdotte successivamente (Arcana, Destroyer, Reaper, Scouter, Sorceress, LanceMaster).\n\n[b]COSE CHE AMO:[/b]\n\n- Combattimento action davvero soddisfacente con combo e tante skill.\n- Mondo di gioco e grafiche spettacolari.\n- Tonnellate di contenuti sbloccabili e collezionabili e attivita' secondarie (Gathering, Fishing, Housing, Sailing, Cards, Achievements, Collectibles).\n- Hack'n'Slash Mmo!\n- Boss fight e raid impressionanti (Davvero, andate a cercare \"Abrelshud Lost Ark\" su Youtube e sbavate!)\n\n[b]Non vedo l'ora di fare gruppo con i miei amici, creare la nostra Gilda e studiare le tattiche e strategie per conquistare i raid piu' difficili.[/b]\n\n\n[b]E' PAY TO WIN?[/b]\n\nDalla definizione del termine e dopo molteplici, INNUMEREVOLI commenti da parte di giocatori russi e koreani, NON LO E'.\n\nIN OGNI CASO, essendo un Free to play, ci sara' sicuramente una monetizzazione da parte di Smilegate e spendere qualche soldo nel cash shop vi portera' sicuramente dei vantaggi, che sia progredire piu' velocemente nel gioco, semplificarvi la vita o ottenere skin sbarluccicose.\nIn ogni caso, mi sento molto sicuro nel rassicurarvi che non dovreste preoccuparvi di rimanere troppo indietro rispetto alle persone che caricano soldi costantemente. Alla lunga li raggiungerete, perche' chi spende molto denaro in questo gioco e' davvero avvantaggiato quando si tratta di contenuti competitivi e/o speedrun varie.\nSe farete parte di una Gilda e giocate in team non avrete di che preoccuparvi per quanto riguarda i contenuti di gioco. Anzi, il PVP e il PVE di alto livello sono entrambi equalizzati, quindi non ci sara' differenza fra chi spende 0 e chi spende 10000.

This has been played spanning a week's time.  I will try to keep this relatively spoiler free, so where I'm vague is where I'm trying not to spoil too much. \n\nCLASSES:\nI played several classes that I did not play in the Alpha test, all of which I listed below with my own brief description:\n- Berserker (Main): Hard hitting, great sword user that can also take a hit and mash enemies like potatoes in large quantities. Although a bit slower than the other classes, it makes up with sheer force and power behind each and every attack.\n- Gunlancer: The Gunlancer will hit foes hard with each ability, take damage like a champion, and defend themselves and allies with their shield. The way a tank class should be. The end.\n- Deadeye: Deadeye is unique and may be overwhelming for some players. This class has not one, not two, but THREE separate weapons (dual pistols, shotgun, and rifle) that you can switch between to chain for huge combos on your enemies. This class is everything a gunslinger could ask for.\n- Sharpshooter: Agile and deadly, the Sharpshooter is a long-range bow class with melee skills too. This makes for a very adaptive class for any situation.\n- Striker: A martial artist at heart, the Striker uses close combat melee skills to eliminate enemies quick and move swiftly to the next. Hit hard and throw some energy based attacks to down opponents as fast as they spawn. \n\nI enjoyed all of the classes I played, but my MMO play style roots deep in heavy classes, hence why I decided to main Berserker. \n\nClasses are well balanced and are unique in their own way through their mobility, basic attacks, general skills, and Identity skill [Z] move. \n\nCONTROLS:\nI play with one hand and with a controller. I used a PowerA Xbox One Wired Controller. \nI cannot express my gratitude enough for the controller (GAMEPAD in Settings) support. The support has button mapping as well as the ability to click and use the mouse cursor with the controller using LS for left-click and RS for right-click! I thought it was truly amazing! It's so simple but takes accessibility to the next level. Again I am beyond grateful the Lost Ark Team put in the effort to make this game so accessible.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is as smooth as butter. Not only how each class plays, but all the other mechanics of the game as well. Each mechanic has a quest line to explain in detail how everything works. For example, there are life skills like fishing and mining that once in a certain village you can speak with a NPC (Non-player character) to learn about how to utilize these skills as well.\nEach class has their strengths that tailor to every play style there is in the MMO genre. You choose your skills and how you play as you progress. I'll leave it at that.\n\nMAP and TRAVEL:\nThere are multiple continents in Lost Ark and travel is very simple yet extensive. You go through very large maps with instanced areas that are open and free to roam in. There are things called Triports that you can fast travel to in various parts of the areas you roam in. The key is to remember that you have to activate these Triports to be able to use them. It does cost some silver every time you fast travel unless you have the Crystalline Aura benefit, I'll talk more about Crystalline Aura later. \nKeep in mind that this game is made of continents, and they definitely feel like it. Each part of the world of Arkesia (The entire world of Lost Ark) has its own people, creatures, and ecosystems that feel alive and have it's own stories to tell. Part of that story is being able to set sail later in the game with your own ship and travel between continents and islands that have various quests and events.\n\nDUNGEONS and RAIDS:\nDungeons in Lost Ark range from short 5 minute runs with one boss, to 40 minute runs with mini bosses, puzzles, and a final boss with amazing mechanics of its own. \nRaids have more mechanics with the necessity to work as a team. Those runs can be smooth and be done in about 30-40 minutes or take a couple hours if you have absolutely no idea what you're doing. Either way it's great content and not taking as long as a Destiny Raid.\n\nGUILDS:\nI recommend joining a Guild as soon as possible. In Prideholme you will unlock access to joining a guild. This is where you'll be able to team up with people throughout your adventure and get a great sense of community meant for an MMO. Guilds can have up to 30 people and it will also make main story content fly by as you work together as a party to complete various tasks. In end-game content you'll work closely with guild members to complete Dungeons and Raids.\n\nPVP (Player vs Player):\nIn PvP in the Arena  you have equal starts and you choose what skills you'll use and where to put your stat points. No one has an advantage over the other because it's all about skill. \nOpen World PvP is different where what you have equipped DOES matter. \nThere is also Guild vs Guild content on islands and such where it DOES matter what gear you have on because it's still technically in the open world.\n\nCRYSTALLINE AURA:\nI\u2019m saying this right off the bat, Crystalline Aura benefits are NOT Pay-To-Win. In my opinion Pay-To-Win is when you pay for benefits that give you an advantage over other players in PvP content. Crystalline Aura gives the following benefits:\n\n- THESE BENEFITS ARE FOR PvE CONTENT ONLY-\n- Triport fee is free.\n- Ocean Liner fee is 50% off. (Traveling between continents without using ship)\n- Daily Rapport Action tries +1 try. (Rapport is with NPCs to receive NON-PvP items)\n- Life Energy natural recovery amounts +10%\n- Usable Bifrost slots +2\n- Song of Return Cooldown -50%\n- Strongholds are obtained through the story.\n- Stronghold Research time -10%\n- Stronghold Crafting time -10%\n- Stronghold Dispatch time -10%\n- Stronghold Action Energy basic recovery amount +10%\n- Stronghold Training Grounds Ultimate Stress Buster unlocked\n(XP Gained Per Minute 7,000). This XP does not affect the Player Combat XP.\n- Crystal Benefactor Title applied (While Crystalline Aura benefit lasts)\n\nIn short, Crystalline Aura does help progress outside of PvP content. Crystalline Aura in accordance with my opinion shows it\u2019s not Pay-To-Win.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nThis game is everything an MMO should be. The world feels alive and is beautiful no matter what settings you have selected. The game is very detailed and complex, but you\u2019re given all the tools to learn in a simple, step-oriented way. You can explore Arkesia however you please. Combat  demons, or go and find your favorite fishing spot and relax. The choice is yours. Everyone is their own special character, and together that\u2019s what makes an MMO truly fun. I haven\u2019t felt this way about an MMO in a very long time and don\u2019t see myself playing any other MMO because they seem half baked compared to this masterpiece. I\u2019ve made friends, played in every moment I could, and I didn\u2019t grow tired of Lost Ark even for a moment. This game is 10/10 for me. Lost Ark deserves the Overwhelmingly Positive rating it has on Steam as of the time of writing this review.\nTo all of the Lost Ark Team, thank you for the fire I\u2019ve been waiting for to ignite my inner MMO player again. I would also like to thank you through these trying times for polishing this game and truly showing that you have every player in mind. The controller support is beyond appreciated. The hype is real, and I\u2019ll be waiting to start my adventure in Arkesia. Until then, stay safe, take care of yourselves, and keep your heads up!\n\nGhositrax The One Hand Gamer.\n", "hours": 4659, "hoursAtReview": 3873, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1636613249}, {"text": "FYI what I'm saying here is purely my opinion, and there are others who have different opinions than mine.\n\n1. Story: As someone who do enjoy reading and watching story, at first, it seemed a little typical hero story, but I think the story slowly builds up to match what Lost Ark is about. The side story quests seems boring as usual, but the main story seems good overall. 7.5/10\n2. Quest: All quests seem to be located around the main story quest, meaning no need to run to the opposite side of the continent to complete the quest, so I find this very convenient and well designed. 9/10\n3. Dungeon: Rather than being that typical dungeon you encounter from playing WoW or FFXIV, this is more like PoE and Diablo portal (sorry I do not recall what term they use) dungeon. It's also nice to have two different modes (Normal and Hard) and have two different options, Party (Matchmaking) and Solo. Soloing the dungeon definitely takes longer compared to doing it with a party, but if you just want to play alone, there is an option to play solo. Also, the dungeons seems easier than I thought it would be, so if you are expecting some kind of challenge, I personally don't think you will find that challenge in dungeons. 8/10\n4. Raid: This is where the fun comes in! Bosses have their own mechanics and your party has to be prepared for those mechanics. Not only mechanics, but the effects and design of each bosses are very cool! Though, some might say that raids are not as difficult due to all the indicators you see, but I think with the limited dodge/movement skills, seeing the indicators isn't too bad. You also do not see the cast bar like in FFXIV raid bosses, so with the indicators, you will be able to tell which mechanics you died to. I personally love raiding, so I will definitely be going for the raid contents when the game officially release! 9/10\n5. Leveling: Not gonna lie, this is the hardest part for me lol. Yes, you can just grind all the way to max level, but I won't lie, it gets really boring. You don't get much EXP from killing mobs, so all the EXP will come from side quests, main story quests, and dungeons. \n6. PvP: I personally have not tried PvP myself yet, but from what I heard and know, everyone gets the same ilvl gears, so it's not like one person will just steamroll you with their super strong gears. This kind of system is very nice as the match will be determined by class knowledge and skills. (I do not know how the balance is, so I am only looking at the system for the rating) 8/10\n7. General Combat: Not much to say here. It is very like Diablo and PoE. At least there are a lot of skill trees to look into and test out, so I think even if the combat is not your type, there is a lot of room for build theory crafting and testing. Same class but could have different playstyle and strategy. 9/10\n8. P2W: Now the REAL topic that could make people either not play this game or play this game. Yes, there are items and features that you can get from paying in this game, as simple as pet(s). However, I do not think this is \"paying to win\". And even the features are not something that makes those who bought it unable to catch up. I personally think the items and features are \"pay for convenience\" rather than \"pay to win\". If you consider this to be P2W, then all I could say is, \"how is this buyer winning you all? Is it impossible for you to catch up to this player ever?\" 8/10\n9. Overall Rating: Overall, I believe this game is amazing! While there are few contents that seems a little weak, such as large scale PvP and possibly dull story/questline, but if you consider this game to be PvE, then I think there are a lot of contents that can be done. Combat isn't too bad as well, especially with all the builds that can be crafted and tested. There might be still a lot of things I haven't done yet, but until what I have experienced, I would like to give 9/10\n\nThank you for reading such a long review. And hope you all could enjoy the game like I have! Definitely looking forward to the release!", "hours": 1984, "hoursAtReview": 1984, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1636596014}, {"text": "It is kinda hard to actually write a recommendation or a review on a game already released in other region and it being extremely popular already. But I would like to mention some points that may help people.\n\nThis game is cluttered with a lot of misinformation and lack of information, which makes sense as all the information feeded to the western audience is either from the Russian Server or the Korean one, which themselves are different from each other.\n\nI never joined either of them and been waiting patiently for a launch so I can experience the game first hand and not being burn out on version a I don't expect to be around, as its an MMO and time investment is one of the primary factors people (me included) look out for.\n\nFirst heavy point I wanna point out, this game is not p2w but it has p2w elements or as I call them \"pay to progress faster\". It is true that you can get some raw materials for upgrade in the shop, faster sailing and other really nice QoL items, but also the game using an exchange rate like gw2, you can exchange gold for crystals and then buy the same stuff that a p2w player might get earlier than you, they don't go away and the exchange rate is not unreachable in the other versions (it didn't exist on beta).\nNow I made it sound like the opposite of what I should when I say its not p2w, so let me explain how gear works and how those upgrade materials make minuscule difference in the grand scheme of things.\nEvery dungeon and raid have a gear score/ilvl entry and there are tiers, in this beta T1 was the only one available with max ilvl entry of 580, you can already get on most of the content as a f2p in 1 day after you get to 50, a p2w player may get access to a higher level than you if he invests thousands upon thousands of $ (which are time gated, he cant buy endlessly the shop resets every 4 hours for some materials) and its then not even guaranteed cause there is an upgrade fail system on items. Even if he does the only thing he achieved is having no dungeon to do till the next tier releases, the term that goes around for those people is \"pay to wait more\". Also every boss has a party wipe mechanic and stomping it with super high ilvl does not exist, no matter what gear you have you will have to respect the game mechanics and your personal responsibility. And this gets harder and harder as Tiers progress.\nYou can access the entire content as a f2p at your own pace, the game even has systems for whenever you don't log half your resets carry over, nothing will force you to play daily, nothing will force you to pay a dime.\nAnd whenever we get T3 (which will probably be a year down the line) the hardest of content have gear equalization so no matter what your gear is, it does not matter. \nWith all that in mind Amazon said they will do their best to keep it non-p2w, this is true in beta, I hope its true on release as well.\nThe same goes for pvp everything is equalized there is not a single instance of someone paying or playing or anything that will get him on a more advantageous spot that you will be, you go in at lvl 26 and you don't even have to go to max level ever and enjoy pvp, even go rank 1 if that's what you wanna commit to.\n\nNow on the why you should try this game, first and foremost is an already proven concept, it exists for the past 3 years and its doing really well spiking at top #1 Korean MMO at times. You are not the play tester, bugs should be kept to an absolute minimum and content updates should be consistent and fast, there is a ginormous amounts of content to be had for every kind of player out there from the most casual to the most hardcore (although the later will have to wait a bit till we get T3 on our region). \nThe animations and sound designs are phenomenal, the story is okay, bit generic but it gets saved from how flashy it gets at times and how good the music in this game is. \nThe combat is out of this world every skill feels like there is a weight to it, from the button press to the move actually hitting the target is just so unique for every different ability with amazing sound effects and also enemy feedback. The dungeons and raids are hard, you will get some time getting used to each boss mechanics and even if you come back way later and try them again they will be exactly as hard as you remember, your personal responsibility will always be there.\nThe map designs are unique and you can tell with how much passion they were made, everything is an eyesore, you will very rarely feel the area you are in is generic. Even the cities are magnificent and each one has a specific theme to it.\nAnd so much more, the game feels polished from start to finish.\n\nOn to the bad stuff.\nThe voice acting is not complete and at places even when it is its either bland or generic or bad. There are translation issues all over the place as well. Most of it is subjected to change due to it being in a beta form and I hope it does.\nAs much as I love exploring new islands and feel like an One Piece pirate crew, on the start of the game your ship is incredibly slow and it can be tedious to move from place to place, and some of the quests require you to constantly sail around after you reach a certain threshold. This gets better down the line but I can see it being a turn off for people.\nThe leveling experience is there just to be a barrier till you reach endgame, there is not much to it besides listening to the story and learning your class. This wouldn't really be a bad point but you will eventually make alts either to feed some materials to your main or to enjoy some other class and it will get boring eventually. This depends on how Amazon wants to approach it and maybe put some level boosts for alts or something QoL.\n\nWhich brings me to my only neutral point, this game is time gated, you can play all day long but you can't progress all day long. You have a number of stuff to do daily and a number of weekly stuff that will help you progress your ilvl/character. There is more content to do besides progressing but if your sole reason is to no-life high end pve content this game does not provide that (and will provide more of that when T3 comes to us).\n\nThis is not a full review, this is not even a half review its what I could think would help people try it. \nDon't listen to me or anyone about investing your time on a game, and don't go in with that mindset, go in to try if its for you, are you having fun? If yes then start searching around for more deep systems and mechanics of it.\n", "hours": 5427, "hoursAtReview": 5427, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1636554373}, {"text": "As someone that played the Russian version of Lost Ark, I really appreciate the changes they did!

There are a at least 6 different endgame progression systems all with depth in their progression. For new players this game is can be extremely daunting in terms of stuff to accomplish once you hit level 50. From the 888 different Makoko seeds to collect to the immense endgame content, there is always something to do. Even little collectibles that usually dont matter in most games, in Lost Ark things such as getting all the collectibles in a specific zone will reward you with character progression items such as permanent stat potions, skill points for abilities, and Runes for your skills there is an endless supply of min-max opportunities. Don't let this scare you though! Even though there is a metric **** ton to do, some (most) of it is optional as they can be only minor increases (by minor I mean \"0.07% increased damage to demons\" type of minor). \n\nLost Ark is also FREE TO PLAY! Though some claim it to be Pay To Win its really up to your definition of that term. This game is no more pay to win than World of Warcraft's Gold Token which costs around $20 USD and gives you gold, the amount is controlled by the community (just like Lost Ark).\n\nTry the game out, its free, if you like it fantastic, if you dont then just move on to another game!

There MUST be many out there who feel just as perplexed as I am feeling. \n\nI am lev 28 and 6 hours in and I felt like I have just done 6 hours of data entry work. The skills are super cool and fun, but their potential is wasted on the unbelievably bad world and main quest. The levels are narrow funnels with a few throwaway trashmobs and the odd \"elite monster.\" The main quest mostly consists of 30 second affairs of walking 10 seconds to kill 3 monsters nearby and talking to an NPC 10 seconds further down the level. The walking speed feels unnecessarily slow, and doubly so for the mounts. This game literally put me to sleep the other day. The dungeons are decent and feature a boss and multiple mini bosses. These were fun and well made, but consist of maybe 10-15% of the levelling experience at most. I thought nothing could ever rival the epic fail that was FF14s base game storyline grind, but I think I that I may have found it. Will it be worth it in lost ark like it was in FF14 which had some of the best story content ever created for a game in its expansions?

Then they pretended to be active developing the game the first two months releasing absurdly tiny updates to buy some time until they can collect the profits from their sales, while at the same time, more victims keep coming, buying and falling into the scam for the time being. Then when finally reached the date to legally cash out all their profits, they did a massive rug-pull crypto fashion and totally dissapeared. They stopped posting updates on steam, also stopped all communication on steam as well, went to one of their sketchy discord servers were they basically act like absolute dictators banning anyone daring to mention all this. They pretended to be active there to keep feeding lies and hopes to the rest of the volunteers that they got around working as slaves totally for free moderating what's left of the game or the community, as damage controllers.\n\nOkicoki as well, one of the main developers did a crusade around youtube taking down many videos from many youtubers denouncing the rampant cheating in the game.

All of them went full rampant banning thousands of players for the most innocuous things during the first 2/3 weeks after the launch, this damaged the game irreversibly, people stopped using in-voice game chat and text-chatting completely due fears of getting banned for basically any word or comment (which in most majority of cases was always completely taken out of context).\n\n- Almost no servers left, totally flatline dead community online, and the few matches around are infested with cheaters since the anticheat does not work, but specially now that the devs dissapeared and moderators are no longer monitoring the reports.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nAvoid this product like the plague, and if you see these developers in the future anywhere else, finger point them and denounce their practices for everyone to see. \n\nGet your money elsewhere and give it to any other honest developer with good faith working hard to deliver good products instead.", "hours": 3351, "hoursAtReview": 3351, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1734259939}, {"text": "I really really really really want to give a thumbs up for this game because its soooo good.

STARSHIPS still works for those who own that one.\n\nOk after checking out the main website for BEYOND EARTH i reinstalled the game after reading that the 2K launcher was removed so i figured maybe it was just a case of reinstalling the game.

Patch 1.6 is certainly a much better game. For now, it's a recommended, but I'll update it to a final verdict when I finish it. So far so good, though.\n\nMy first foray with this 'series' was the 2015 game, which I was crazy enough to 100%, but can't say I enjoyed much at all. Truly one of the most generic games I ever played, but this one is a little different. \n\nFinal review after completion:\n\nThis game is good, it has some unique concepts to the genre and a lot going for it. I find it best to list it in a simple format of pros and cons.\n\n(Review edited again after playthrough 3)\n\n+Graphics are gorgeous.\n\n+Performance is great for me, a big improvement compared to last year where I got traversal stutter a lot.\n\n+Weapon and armor variety is on par with FROM's roster.\n\n+Some standout bosses like Judge Cleric are absolutely fantastic. Edit: as is Pieta and Elianne the Starved.\n\n+Level structure. We're back to the old school Demon's Souls formula here: where the level itself is the real challenge trying to kill you, not the boss at the end. For me, this is a huge plus as FROM's later games have become boss gauntlets which you run past on repeat playthroughs. \n\n+Varied playstyles. I started out sword and board, but quickly swapped to a hybrid Radiant spellcaster and had a ton of fun. Spells are OP in this game, and I like that.\n\n+Persistent item drops.  Remember all the times in FROMsoft games where an enemy drops something you really wanted, or you open a chest, but then you die and when you respawn the item is gone? Not in LotF. The items are persistent and will remain on the ground until you leave the area.\n\n+Umbral. I thought this would be an annoying gimmick, but I love that every area has side paths, secrets and whole enemy encounters you otherwise would miss simply playing in Axiom (the overworld). I loved this concept in Soul Reaver and I love it here.\n\n+Shortcuts. Interconnectivity in this is great, a real inspired choice to include it.\n\n+Length. For a first blind playthrough, I clocked in well over 40 some hours. Every time I felt like I completed a major event, the game had more to discover.\n\n+Far less obscurity than FROM and its imitators. Lore is simple and to the point, NPCs dont end every dialogue with a question to bait Youtubers into making lore videos, and the world provides some concrete answers.\n\n+Bonus lore/descriptions and tips for those who invest in the 'religions' of the game through Radiance and Inferno stats. \n\n+Commitment to the players.  Seeing this game was on patch 1.6 at the time of writing had me intrigued enough to pick it back up after dropping and refunding it at launch in 2023. The end result is a much different game to when it released, and I love that there's not only new achievements for all the free additional content and modifiers, but you aren't penalised for using any of them either.\n\n+NPC summons are tough, but balanced enough that they will get stomped if you rely on them to carry you. Not only that, but each NPC has unique voice lines and intros upon being summoned into a boss fight, which creates a more familiar sense of camaraderie with them than even in FROMs games - though FROM has been dabbling with this, like in Shadow of the Erdtree.\n\n+Armour and weapons: these are the coolest in the genre, from visual design to sheer bad-a**ery, you look and feel like a champ.\n\n+Online multiplayer. This is the best cooperative multiplayer in any Souls-like, even besting out FROMs. Its only competitor could be Elden Ring seamless coop mod. \n\n+Different modes and modifiers increase replay value exponentially. I decided to fire up a second playthrough at the time of this edit, this time turning on upgraded loot, randomised loot, and randomised enemies and increased enemy density. It feels like a whole new playthrough now. \n\n~ Neutral: The vestige seeds are a novel concept, being able to make your own bonfires like the cut content of Dark Souls 3 is a great idea, but the game becomes overly dependent on them in the latter half and you go long stretches without proper vestiges. \n\n\n-Endings are awful. Some of the most abrupt, low-budget resolution in the genre.\n\n-Repeated enemies. This is a cardinal sin. You cannot expect a boss you make for a game to have lasting impact if in the next area you're fighting 4 weaker versions of them. Enemy variety in this game in general is pretty lacking; you'll fight the same enemies for much of its duration, with some elemental buffs here and there to give the illusion of a 'different' enemy. Not only that, but the game seems to think putting the same enemies you fought in the first area in the endgame area but giving them way more health is somehow good design.  \n\n-NPC questlines. Some of these are just...bad. You can fail entire questlines without warning simply by opening a door after a boss and the game treating it as you 'missing' the NPC's request. In addition, one of the questlines bugged out on me and I had to resort to a workaround to get the required enemy to spawn. These NPCs are all vendors, too, so you can lose out on some good loot without warning.  Another thing, NPCs require you to summon some of them X amount of times during boss fights. Sounds simple enough right? Well, if you first try the boss, you'll never be able to summon them because summoning only unlocks for bosses you die to. Punished for being good. Speaking of being punished for being good, if you kill the Lightreaper earlier than his Upper Calrath encounter, it breaks an NPCs questline too!\n\n-Bugs. Not only did an NPC questline bug out on me entirely, but I've had instances of clipping through the geometry, some levels having missing textures, enemies falling through the ground and if you use your Sanguinarix and swap to another item and use that quickly, the game ques the input and will use your Sanguinarix twice.\n\n- Some of the bosses just suck. Spurned Progeny is ridiculous; he has a one-shot AOE attack you have to pray RNG blesses you with him not using, otherwise you are going to die. Maxed Vitality? Doesn't matter, it'll kill you anyway. This is not good game design. Some of the bosses also blatantly read inputs.\n\n- Lack of weight/stagger on weapons. I used a longsword for the entire playthrough, so perhaps bigger weapons differ, but I noticed very rarely would my attacks interrupt an enemy if they already began their animation. It's as if they took the hyper armor from Dark Souls 2 and cranked it to 11. \n\n- High CPU usage led to a bluescreen for me, but this is the one occurrence in 80 hours of play.\n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR DEVS:\nPlease add a flag/checkmark for items we own, as there are way too many items to keep track of for completionist achievements. \nA permanent vestige moth we can unlock would also be amazing. \nA way to farm Umbral Scourings outside of Crucible, maybe as a low drop % chance.\nA colour indicator of loot drops to distinguish between consumables/materials and weapons/armour. \n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a very high 7/10. If you were torn on this or Lies of P, however, I say get that. That being said, LotF 2023, Surge 2 and Lies of P are so far, the only Souls-Likes I feel are worth a play. It's said the sequel to this is coming to Epic Games Store only, which is a shame, as I'll only be buying it if it's on Steam - but that's the key takeaway - I liked this game enough to want to play another one.\n\nA misunderstood game that continues to get better. 5 playthroughs all in all, all achievements.  Patch 1.7 just came out and has fixed the enemy magnetism and BS tracking that I complained about in the previous version of this review.

I was in your shoes at one point.\n\nI'm the kind of person that hyper-fixates on the negatives, and I can always find something to be critical of if I need to. I very rarely go back to games that didn't manage to scratch an itch in just the right way, as I've been gaming a majority of my life, and I'm not lenient with my opinions. I'm a massive pain the ass to satisfy. It's not something I'm proud of, but we all have things we don't like about ourselves.\n\nHaving said that:\n\n[b]Lords of the Fallen is one of the most engaging souls-like experiences I have had since I first played Dark Souls.[/b]\n\n[b]POTENTIAL DEALBREAKERS:[/b] \nIf you can handle:\n[list] \n[*]Occasional janky targeting\n[*]Weapon types sharing movesets (i.e. short swords share lights and heavies, but may have special moves unique to the item)\n[*]Low-difficulty bosses (a few exceptions/build & playstyle dependent)\n[*]Mini-bosses that become normal enemies shortly after facing them\n[*]Mediocre PvP implementation\n[*]Below-average enemy variety\n[/list]\nThen you will likely love this game, just as I do. This list describes the only reasons I could imagine someone being put off from this game. It executes absurdly well on every other aspect.\n\n\n[h3]Exploration:[/h3]\nLotF has level design that rivals Dark Souls in its presentation. The interweaving shortcuts, the vistas revealing places you will eventually arrive to explore in-person, and the NPC quests that don't require turning over every single pebble on the map (looking at you Elden Ring.)\n\nI truly cannot express how many times I would take an elevator, open a locked door, or drop a ladder only to find myself thinking, \"Holy shit, this connects back to THERE?\" \n\nStepping into the Umbral feels great, as they did not skimp on the level design unique to the second dimension. You will find yourself scaling skeletal mountains and platforming through precarious eyeball-ridden purple hellscapes.\n\nI have not enjoyed exploring every nook and cranny of a game in a long time, as I tend to get anxious thinking I'll miss something, or I get caught up knowing I'm running out of time before my weekend is over. LotF manages to make exploration rewarding enough that I never feel stressed about unlocking and discovering each new secret.\n\n[h3]Weapons & Builds:[/h3]\nThe reason LotF has managed to make exploration so rewarding, is due to how flexible their build system is. Unlike Soulsborne games, where being a mage requires thumbing through your list of spells and items like you're playing old-school Monhun games, you have [b][i]assignable hotkeys![/i][/b] Michael Zaki eat your heart out. \n\nYou equip a catalyst separate from your sword, shield, bigger sword, double shield, or whatever else you heathens come up with. You have a dedicated ranged slot that allows you to be a scrappy throwable build, archer build, or spellcaster, without sacrificing your ability to engage in melee combat. You can slot runes into your gear to allow them to scale better with certain stats, creating abominations of cross-stat weaponry. Throwables regenerate upon resting, so you don't need to constantly restock them just to have a viable build.\n\nYou want to be a true paladin that casts auras and face-tanks bosses, while chucking giant spears of lightning, beating them down with oversized hammers and a wall of a shield? You can do it.\n\nYou want to fling literal ball-peen hammers into the faces of your enemies, stunning them, only to run up and ram your fist through the back of their spine? You can do it.\n\nYou want to tap into the Eldritch Mother-being of All Creation and melt the vitality from your foes, as they gaze into a never ending abyss that you have brought forward for them to face in their final moments? You can do it.\n\nWhen you see an enemy use a spell, there is a VERY high chance that you can unlock that spell for yourself. There is no end to the items I found that had me thinking of trying an entirely new build. \n\nThe best part? The game has built-in modifiers for new playthroughs. Want to randomize all non-key items? Go for it. Want them to only drop as their fully upgraded versions? Yep. Want to randomize all the enemies? Yep.\n\n[h3]Story & NPCs:[/h3]\nIt is genuinely impressive to me that HEXWORKS managed to create a generic storyline and world, along with many of the usual cliches, and still have me feel invested in the development of the characters and their world. I truly wanted to unsurface the deeper mysteries taking place. I wanted to understand the chaos they faced, where it came from, and if I could actually break them free of its unending torture.\n\nYou are constantly meeting new people, finding old faces in new places, and stumbling your way through their respective questlines only hoping that you are doing the right thing. Everyone you meet is such a character, and even those that feel campy are a breath of fresh air among all the unending seriousness.\n\nThe three different endings give you objectives to strive for, and more than enough reason outside of the modifiers, NPC quests, and builds options to replay the game. \n\n[h3]TL;DR:[/h3] LotF is easily one of the best souls-likes for people looking to return to what made Demon's Souls & Dark Souls feel so special. You won't find nail-bitingly difficult bosses, or ultra-twitchy input-reading combo spammers like in Elden Ring, but you do find some of the best locales and level designs in the Souls-like genre (the Soulsborne series included.) \n\nThe potential for builds is unrivaled, the story is generic, but greatly enjoyable, and the world is so clearly, deeply loved by the devs. Please give this game a chance, and take your time going through it.

I haven't finished it, but I definitely enjoy it much more than some other souls-like titles. Maybe even more than some other original souls. \r\nI think that people are just determined to hate this game for whatever reason. I even heard that mods on the subreddit remove positive reviews (don't know if it's true). Anyway, let's break it down.\r\n\r\nLet's address some of the previous complaints:\r\n1. Poor performance. At the beginning, there seemed to have been some performance issues, especially in zones with lots of water. This have been addressed in the patches and updates, and I haven't seen any lags whatsoever. I do run it on some good hardware though. But I think that this is no longer an issue anyway.\r\n2. Too many enemies. The enemy density at launch was a bit much, looking at the playthroughs on YT and I can see how it must have been ruining the enjoyment of the game. They have corrected that, and I believe now the enemy density is just about right, what you would expect. It's not too easy, still a challenge to get to the next checkpoint, but manageable, even if you need to go through the same section a couple of times.\r\n3. Not enough weapon move sets. I saw this in one review, and, I have no idea what they were talking about. You have all your regular types of weapons, and each has a different move set, plus it differs for one-handing and two-handing it. It's not like Elden Ring had 100 different weapon move sets, so, don't agree with this complaint. \r\n4. Too many ambushes, including the ones that drop you off the ledges. Well, that's basically all souls games for you - always check your surroundings before blindly running towards a shiny. Plus, with the game mechanics with two worlds, one of which you enter when you die the first time (Umbral), I haven't found it to be annoying, and, honestly, it only caught me off guard once in 43 hours of gameplay. \r\n5. There are probably more, but I don't care.\r\n\r\nNow, let's talk about all the good things that make this game absolutely amazing, a worthy addition to the souls-like genre, and even better than some other titles (I won't be pointing fingers).\r\n\r\nCOMBAT\r\nThe combat is very versatile, and I found myself using different types of play styles, and switching between them with ease.\r\nThis is the first game ever where I actually use charge attacks. I remember when they added like weapon arts to DS3, I believe, and I haven't seen a single person using them. Here, the charged attacks are usable, and sometimes better to use then your regular ones.\r\nBlock and parry mechanic is great. It's hard to get used to, especially if you don't want to use a shield (with shields it's easier), but it's satisfying. Basically, when you block or parry, you don't receive direct damage, but wither damage, that you can get back by attacking an enemy. And this encourages both aggressive and defensive play styles and allows you to choose which one to use when. \r\nStagger mechanic is also satisfying once you get the hang of it. Once you depleted your enemy posture a kick or a charged attack will stagger them and you can deliver a grievous strike for some extra damage.\r\nDodging feels very good, the i-frames are great. But the game doesn't allow you to just dodge forever, so you need to be mindful of your stamina.\r\nThe way ammunition works is different from all other games I've seen and actually makes it easier to use bows/crossbows and throwables. And boy, you will want to use them sometimes. You don't have a limited amount of arrows/bolts/throwables, instead you have limited ammunition bar, and it recharges when you rest, or you can fill it up with a consumable. \r\nAll of these things make the combat satisfying, strategic and tactical. You can really develop a style of play, try different things to see what works best for you. It's really fluid.\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION\r\nExploration is something that I missed a lot in Lies of P. \r\nIn Lords of the Fallen they nailed the level design. They need an award for this.\r\nThe world is incredibly interconnected, you can lose yourself, find new paths, unlock new zones. And with the Umbral mechanic (the two worlds) this makes exploration even more satisfying when you find hidden platforms or ladders. \r\nEvery playthrough I saw (and there are not enough of them, btw!), the players would take different paths, and end up in different places. And this is so refreshing after Lies of P linear progression.\r\n\r\nBOSSES\r\nI haven't finished the game, so I don't know what's coming, but the bosses I fought so far have been nicely done. Interesting move sets, all different. It's fun to find the best ways to beat them. \r\nAnd I didn't feel like they were cheating, or that my i-frames or attacks weren't registering, any sort of BS that makes you wanna smash your controller.\r\nBoss fights seem fair and satisfying.\r\n\r\nNEW MECHANICS\r\nThis game introduces some awesome mechanics that we haven't seen anywhere before: the Umbral realm. \r\nAs mentioned above, this is a second world, the underworld, sort of, that looks a bit different from your main world, but opens up other types of enemies, loot, and pathways. \r\nIt also introduces soulflaying, which is basically snapping your enemy's soul out of their body. This creates some fun ways for combat. \r\nYou can also plant seedlings in certain places to create a new vestige (LOTF bonfire) to rest and level up. And this make exploration fun as well. The static vestiges may be rare, especially as you progress through the game, so you may want to use your seedlings to create a temporary resting spot along the way. Of course, these are not unlimited, so you need to be strategic. This is also a good way to make boss runs much shorter when needed. \r\n\r\nAll-in-all, this is a very enjoyable experience, at least now in 2024. I haven't played the game when it released. \r\n\r\nIf you like souls games, you will like this one.

Any substantial performance and balancing issues (what caused the original mixed reviews) have been voided by the first 6 months of updates, and for some reason they still release patches after that was accomplished.\n\nThis game is innovative enough to set itself apart in the genre but not so innovative that it kills what made its foundation great. A lot of the criticism this game got was a classic example of bullying the new kid on the block. Another iteration of the \"you're not fromsoft\" nonsense. Listen, guys, if we're ever gonna get a better game than Dark Souls, we gotta quit the Miyazaki d!ckr!ding, aight?\n\nAfter beating the game on patched settings, I played it again on the pre-patch settings, AND ADDED several more difficulty settings that were later introduced (e.g. original enemy density + less vestiges + etc. etc.) and it was plenty balanced. I'd looked through months of reviews and community posts trying to figure out why people felt like it wasn't, and every time it looked like I'd gotten close to a real reason, the ugly \"you're not fromsoft\" comparison came up again. Honestly, the original dark souls was way less balanced than this game is. I'm a major slut for Fromsoft and I gotta admit, this game's got way more polish than the vast majority of non-Armored Core games they have made.\n\nSeriously, the main problem I have with this game is that it's not hard ENOUGH. I want MORE difficult bosses. Well, that and the enemy variety - but it's not so limited that it gets old by the time you beat it, so it's not much of a problem unless you intend on beating the game more than two or three times. But on the subject of difficulty, anyone who isn't a souls vet will find it plenty challenging, and those who are will have varying mileage.\n\nIt's much more cinematic than a lot of soulslikes are, and I love that, because the genre's difficulty and combat mechanics really do open games up to spectacle and action-storytelling, but this opportunity is often ignored. Not LOTF. I'm a sucker for the cinematic and aesthetic elements of soulslikes, it's one of the strong points of the genre, and LOTF nails every bit of it. Music, landscape designs, character designs, story motifs, all of it is on point and not lacking at all in consistent presence of atmosphere. That's a lot more than most soulslikes can say, to be honest, and it's refreshing not least because of that.\n\nThat said, do not expect as much of a boss-fighter as something like Sekiro, which makes a very strong emphasis on the uniquity and durability of its bosses. This game is more about the overall journey than the duels that take place with particular enemies therein. The combat itself - which is not all there is to the game, as they invented mechanics to allow for genuinely fun world traversal, unlike certain founding figures in the genre (looking at you Fromsoft) - is a bit generic to the genre, lacking the nuance and refinement that turns bosses into delicate duels, so instead the focus of the combat is a bit more towards horde-slaying. Especially in Umbral. There's cool bosses, but none are super in-depth.\n\nIf you look really, REALLY closely at the title, you'll find a little secret that a lot of early players seemed to have missed: this game is not Dark Souls.

Explore randomly generated regions of diverse fantasy worlds with a wide variety of generation and gameplay rules to choose from. Pick new tomes of magic that grant you new spells, units and buildings, allowing you to adapt to the flow of the game, or create a faction of your dreams. Create your custom factions with a very flexible system allowing to brew anything you might think off (with reasonable limits ofc) and even if you don't play them, you can meet them as an AI player.\r\n\r\nThe only real downside of the game is that in the scenario without a special win condition the generic win-conditions are pretty boring and similar (get control of several similar objectives, proclaim your victory and defend them against opponents for a number of turns).

Recently I gave the game a second chance with release of DLC the Ways of War and I am so happy I did. While it was a fun experience on release, with newer updates the game got so much more depth.\n\nOne way I'd describe the game is intense and concise. \nCompared to other Paradox games already like CK3 or Stellaris, this delivers on experience than can be wrapped up much quicker with rewarding meta progression even when you lose, Perfect for someone who likes creating varied faction synergies and either playing them or encounter them. Information AOW4 provides often does a lot of the math for you, so you don't have to bring your own calculator to this game.\nAfter setting up the game, which is actually a fun part of it's own, default game is set to 150 turns. This makes games last in range of 2 days to a week of gaming unlike the near infinite campaigns of other Paradox games. This works so much better for multiplayer experience. With the addition of cloud hosted games where you can take your turns even when everyone else is offline makes the game flow better. Reminds me a lot of correspondence chess. On the matter of intensity, with the 150 turn limit every decision on how you navigate between different victory conditions and your strategy in combat will hugely affect the outcome of a battle.\n\nAll in all, I'd say this makes it the most amazing Paradox and maybe even 4X game for multiplayer that offers as much fun in singleplayer.\nThe DLC themselves may not look the price, but every bit of variety just adds additional flavor and combinations.

The AI gets hung up regularly and forgets it's its turn, softlocking the game and forcing you to revert the turn every time it happens.

With each DLC I kept hoping it would finally become the game I wanted, but AoW4 severely suffers from issues stemming from the core design rather than a lack of content.\n\nIf you're expecting a game with the depth of Stellaris because AoW4 is published by Paradox, then I urge you to turn back and buy something else.\n\n**+** Decent artwork.\n\n**-** Cultures are shallow. Each culture has 6 unit types, including scouts which are useless for combat, and the majority of their building chains are the same. They've since added a few more cultures in DLCs, but they suffer from the same issue of having no depth.\n\n**-** Combat is generally just bad. Tactics matter far less than unit types, abilities, and spells. If you're coming from a game like Total War you're going to be pretty disappointed. Battles are monotonously slow, to the point where having three stacks of units (18 in total) will take you hours to complete, and most players will auto-resolve.\n\n*However, auto-resolve does fully simulate battles instead of just crunching numbers, which I would say is one of the only good features AoW4 has.*\n\n**-** The strategic map gameplay / empire management is also shallow (see below)\n\n\u2022 The game only has four resources: food, production, draft, and gold. Food increases pop growth, production builds stuff, draft creates units of x turns, and gold buys buildings and units.\n\n\u2022 No resource sharing between cities. So you can't have a city specced for something like food production.\n\n\u2022 Can't build multiple of structures like blacksmiths. Cities don't even have building slots, you're simply limited to one of each building, with a few buildings requiring specific province improvements.\n\n\u2022 The games abstracts almost everything down into the city-specific 'production' resource. Wood? Stone? These don't exist as real resources in AoW4, foresters and quarries just give you flat bonuses for your production rate. It's designed to be as simple as possible because the devs don't trust players to have working brains. You can't even focus your citizens into doing anything specific, and even if you could the mechanical depth just isn't there for it.\n\n\u2022 The AI is abysmal. The only way to get any challenge out of it is to play on brutal, where the only difference is *drumroll* the AI gets resource bonuses.\n\n\u2022 \"Free Cities\" on the map, essentially a lamer version of Civilization's city states.

There are a handful of \"Story Realms\" but they are not a substitute. Triumph's expectation is that you'll create realms (randomly generated with a few features you set) and just play by yourself with bots.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThere are other issues but I'm honestly sick of writing about this game.\n\nIf you're unsure, please take time to watch AoW4 gameplay on youtube so you can see for yourself.

Some of the set pieces in Half-Life Alyx stunned me. In the first opening scene, I just stood there for about 15 minutes looking over a balcony at City 17 and the Citadel with my jaw dropped. As I play the game, I feel compelled to take my time, to observe the richness and detail of the world. Something as mundane as picking up a piece of litter like a beer bottle or floppy disk and being able to read the text on it makes the world feel so much more rich and tangible. \n\nTo date, this is the most high production-value and polished VR game I've ever played. The visual fidelity and richness is absolutely stunning. The sound design. The atmosphere. The voice acting. The level designs. The character designs. The smoothness of gameplay. Everything is top-tier. I truly feel like I'm immersed in a cinematic experience.   \n\nCONS\n\nI will say, it's a pretty linear and simple shooter in the classic Half-Life formula plus a pinch of very simple resource hunting and crafting. You progress through the levels in a linear fashion, solving some world/physics puzzles. That's not really a con in my view. Just don't expect \"revolutionary\" gameplay. It's nothing new shooter-wise or Half-Life-wise except that it's wrapped in a super immersive and rich VR experience. \n\nEven though this is the best-looking, polished and complete VR experience to date, it is showing its age. Some of the VR-specific mechanics do feel a bit dated in their design compared to more modern VR experiences. \n\nSwitching weapons/tools is a matter of navigating a sub-menu interface on your hand, rather than actually holstering/unholstering them off your body, which more modern VR games have figured out. \n\nPistol magazines cannot be filled between firefights, so if you want to conserve ammo, you're stuck having to go into firefights with partially filled mags or having to discard those mags entirely if you want a fully loaded gun before the next firefight. \n\nYou can move around freely and have the option for continuous turning (snap turning is the default). BUT, there is no jumping unfortunately. So to mount platforms, you're stuck with using a \"teleport\" movement mechanic (which breaks immersion in my opinion), or a clunky vaulting mechanic. \n\nA weird performance quirk: I found that the frame rate takes a big hit if the game window is focused. This is particularly apparent when I'm trying to play the game at 120 fps. If the game window is focused, the fps will drop and fluctuate between 60 and 90 fps. Just make sure to click outside of the game window to fix the issue.  \n\nSETUP\n\nI play on a Quest 3, tethered to my PC (5800X3D, 4070 Ti), at 2064x2208 per eye, 120 Hz & fps. Ultra settings. I really recommend settling for nothing less than that. This game NEEDS to be experienced at its full potential. I tried playing wirelessly, but it just doesn't look as crisp and fluid. A word of warning, trying to get this game to run on a Quest 3 at 2064x2208 @ 120 Hz is a bit finicky and unstable. I got it to work reliably enough, but you could always settle for 90 Hz instead for peace of mind.", "hours": 1472, "hoursAtReview": 1136, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733920180}, {"text": "Justifies buying VR.

This kind of interaction showcases the depth of immersion VR can provide, making you feel like you're truly part of the world.\n\nExploration in the game is incredibly satisfying. Interacting with objects feels natural and engaging.

It\u2019s a visual treat that enhances the sense of presence in the game.\n\nCombat is both fun and challenging, but what truly stands out is the intimate interaction with your weapons.

Not bad, though.

Introduction[/h1]\n          For every series, be it a movie, a videogame, or any form of media, there comes a time when it would have a crisis on what it wants to be. Saints Row is no exception. Most of the series' fans know its history and this gives them reasons for what\u2019s right or wrong in each game. Many of the things from the previous games were abandoned and at times, replaced with ones that became subjective depending on the players; be it a prior fan of the last games or a newcomer. A change of direction for games isn\u2019t always bad; to have a game from a series containing the same mechanics as the last game lacks innovation and can make the players feel like they\u2019re buying something they\u2019ve already owned. \n\nHowever, if such changes become too much to the point that the identity of the game changes, it can drive the fans from the previous games to step away from the series overall. A balanced change is of course the most pleasant where the game is still what it is, but the changes bring a new form of excitement for the players, but this isn\u2019t always the case.  Saints Row: The Third was the game that introduced me to the franchise and even if it was criticized for being the black sheep of the series, I still enjoyed it. Even if the game lacked the unique activities present in Saints Row 2, The presence of the previous game is still somewhat there. I then tried to play Saints Row IV and the next thing I knew I had my character jumping on buildings.\n\nIt was odd to still think that this is \u201cSaints Row\u201d but upon finishing the game, I had fun. This weird transition from a crime game to a superhero game has got to be one of the most unusual things that ever happened in a video game series. Even I couldn\u2019t blame the previous fans for their dislike of the latest entries. But even after all the unusual changes, Saints Row IV still respected the previous games, and this was mostly through the inclusion of characters from Saints Row 2. Their story from the past had been a part of this game, being a reminder of what Saints Row was before. The game also includes references related to the Matrix, Terminator, and even Transformers! Making this game not only a tribute to classic Saints Row fans but to Sci-Fi nerds as well.\n\n[h1]II. Story Summarization[/h1]\n\nAfter the events of Saints Row: The Third, the game made you the president of the United States. The ending of the previous game involved a choice between saving Shaundi, Viola, and the Mayor or Killing Killbane but on the introduction of Saint\u2019s Row IV, Shaundi survived but not Viola, and the Mayor. Killbane also happens to be dead. Aliens, called the \u201cZin\u201d suddenly invaded the Earth with their leader being named \u201cZinyak\u201d. They then captured the Saints as well as the player. After the invasion, the Zin placed their captives in a simulation where they were being tortured by their worst fears. \n\nThe player isn\u2019t exempted from this and is placed in a peaceful version of Steelport. The player then realizes how weird everything is and does certain things to break the flow of the simulation which then introduces Kinzie (who oddly has access to a computer after being abducted??) to help the player escape the simulation. After escaping the fear-based simulation, the player mostly relies on Kinzie to know everything about it. This includes knowing about superpowers as well as the state of the other Saints. The two of them worked together to free the rest of the crew from Zinyak\u2019s hands as well as try to liberate Earth from the Zin.\n\n[h1]III. Gameplay[/h1]\n\n[h3]Character Creation and Customization:[/h3]\n\nSaints Row has been known for its extensive character customization. This game is no different. The game has the same way of customizing your character mostly through sliders just like in Saints Row: The Third. So, you can still create your disgusting abominations or your husbandos or waifus. New customization items have been added but most of the items are from the previous game with some of them having to be replaced with new ones. Like in the previous games, vehicles are still customizable. Even though most players may prefer using superpowers instead of vehicles, it\u2019s still there for the people who want it. New vehicles can also be found in the game. The only downside is that watercrafts present in the previous game are removed for some reason.\n\n[h3]Superpowers:[/h3]\n\nThis game being a superhero simulation involves inhuman abilities. To be specific, the ability to jump to the height of buildings and as well as the ability to run faster than cars. The game also involves superpowers mainly:  [b]Blast [/b], a power that makes the player project fire and ice. [b]Telekinesis[/b] \u2013 a power used for lifting objects and throwing them around. [b]Super Stomp[/b], which makes objects and enemies fly in the air due to its exerted force on the ground, and [b]Buff[/b] which gives the player the ability to shoot flaming and freezing bullets at targets. It can also freeze and incinerate anyone if they\u2019re near the player. These are just the basic types of powers; others are included in the DLCs. \n\n[h3]Weapons:[/h3]\n\nWhat\u2019s a Saints Row game without weapons? The game has a variety of weapons compared to Saints Row: The Third. In terms of variety, not only skins are added in the game but weapons that do more than just shoot bullets. Examples of these are the [b]Abduction Gun, Black Hole Gun, Inflato-Ray, Plunger Gun, and many more[/b]. Just like superpowers, some of the weapons are unlocked through the DLCs. \n\n[h3]Upgrades:[/h3]\n\nThe game allows the player to purchase upgrades for health, superpowers, weapons, and more though it suffers from the same problem that the previous game had which is not having a revert option. This is crucial since not every player can judge whether they like an effect through the description alone. It had to be tested. Regardless, this is how the game works, and saving before purchasing an upgrade is always encouraged.\n\n[h1]IV. The Re-Elected \u201cuPgRaDe\u201d[/h1]\n\nAfter the release of the reboot of Saints Row, the developers decided to release an update for Saints Row IV. The original Saints Row IV lets you buy individual DLCs containing cosmetics, superpowers, weapons, and others. To buy all the DLCs is to buy The Game of the Century Edition. The Re-Elected update also treats the DLCs just like what the Game of the Century Edition does but there\u2019s a problem: You can\u2019t play the game for more than 15 minutes without it crashing. On top of that, a lot of mods don\u2019t work properly, most mods don\u2019t work at all. \n\nA lot of people also panic about the fact that the game included a program that\u2019s related to Epic and assume that it\u2019s the Epic Games Store. It\u2019s not. Do something to stop your ignorance. It\u2019s just an Epic service for co-op to function properly. That is if you can start the game without it kicking you to the desktop. With all these issues in mind, it\u2019s either the Re-Elected version or the original version of the game which doesn\u2019t include any of the DLCs.\n\nOne of the biggest downsides of this is that you can\u2019t even buy individual DLCs anymore and can only activate the DLCs with a third-party software. All of this is troublesome especially if you just want to play without having to fix the game that you just bought. It is laughable that they did their best to break this game just so that they could pull people towards their new and faulty product. \n\nTL; DR\n\nDo I recommend Saints Row IV? \n\nYes. \n\nDo I recommend buying it from this store?\n \nNo. \n\nGo get the Game of the Century Edition from GOG. \n\nIf you can\u2019t, go sail the seven seas.\n\nIt\u2019s worth it.", "hours": 14594, "hoursAtReview": 14359, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733470979}, {"text": "Takes the crazy to the next level with superpowers and outrageous missions.

As someone with thalassophobia (fear of deep water), I actually managed to play Below Zero in short bursts, a feat I couldn\u2019t accomplish with the original. Sure, the deep-sea dread is still there, but it\u2019s dialed down enough that I could explore without wanting to yeet myself out of my chair. Hardcore fans of Subnautica's horror might grumble at the lighter tone, but for players like me, this was a welcome change.\n\nLet\u2019s talk story, because that\u2019s where Below Zero truly shines. The launch version is fine - serviceable, even if some of the dialogue feels corny or oddly robotic. But if you get your hands on the beta, you know the real magic happened there. The beta storyline felt tighter, more human, and better at connecting you to the characters. Still tho, Marguerite is a certified badass, and Al-An is one of the most intriguing characters I\u2019ve come across in gaming. The dynamic between Robin and Al-An is the emotional core of the game, and by the end, I was borderline misty-eyed. I love em.\n\nThat said, Below Zero desperately needs a map. Exploration is at the heart of the game, but the constant \u201cwhere the hell am I?\u201d moments can turn your adventure into a frustrating slog. Unless you want to live on YouTube guides, prepare to get lost - a lot.\n\nStill, it\u2019s hard to stay mad at a game that wraps its story so well. The ending? Chef\u2019s kiss. I can\u2019t say much without spoilers, but it left me genuinely hopeful for Subnautica 2. If Robin, Al-An, and OG protagonist Ryley ever cross paths, it\u2019ll be the event of the century.\n\nIn the end,it\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a fantastic evolution of the Subnautica formula. Just give us a map next time, yeah? And the people who needlessly hate on this game are super frustrating. If you want your isolationist horror, go play the original.

However, the final updates and the mods (Invictus in particular) have transformed this into a solid game. Unlike some other Paradox games, this one has a positive feel to it. There is always some achievement down the road that feels good, even as it holds the player back with appropriate \"punishment\" (food, aggressive expansion, integration, happiness, etc.) if they expand too far too fast. The systems work well, and it genuinely feels good to play.\n\nParadox can't be blamed for abandoning a game that doesn't sell, even if the lack of sales is largely their fault, however it may be worth the financial risk of attempting a \"relaunch\" using an appropriate dlc that incorporates some of the modders improvements with some of Paradox's own  ideas (any such relaunch dlc will need to extend the timeline to provide the \"grand strategy\" marketing necessary to justify a legitimate relaunch. The triumvirates are \"ripe\" for the picking).  My guess is that if it's handled properly, it will succeed. They have the time period, the mechanics, the exceptionally nice map, and very positive recent customer reviews. The only question is can they draw in more purchasers who will actually play the game and justify the attempted resurrection?  \n\nObviously, no company wants to throw \"good money after bad\" and it does make sense to just accept the \"sunk cost\" of a failed venture and chalk it up to the cost of doing business. But on the other hand, comparing the cost of  relaunching a game that has such potential at this point to that of developing a new title from scratch seems to be worth the risk. A grand strategy gamming company can't do any better than the Roman time period, and this game has so much dlc possibilities that it must be tempting for them to consider.

That is usually relegated to the female witnesses in the cult who are second class citizens. I know many victims of this cult who suffered personally. This does not even go into doctrine in which witnesses are just wrong, or into their shunning policy that destroys families or the nonsensical blood doctrine that has killed children that they proudly display on the covers of magazines which is disgusting. There is an ocean of abuse that has been perpetrated by this cult for about 100 years now, I can go at length about this but there are a ton of resources I will link below for those curious. \n\nI need you to understand this about the cult that I used to be a part of so you can also understand how the story of this game, which is very much about religion and cults, affected me on a deep personal level which I will get into at the bottom of this review. \n\nNow onto the game itself, I didn't actually know what the game was about, I just knew it was made by one of my favorite developers. I finally decided to complete this game and wow, it was just the game I needed to play right now. I will summarize the good/bad/neutral points of the game below:\n\n[h2] Positive [/h2]\n\n[list]\n [*] Fantastic story and characters\n [*] Fantastic player agency, lots of great quests. Many solutions to quests that trust the player's intelligence and don't hand hold too much which was awesome\n [*] Lots of dialogue skill checks and role play opportunities\n [*] Satisfying almost Diablo-like combat (although very chaotic)\n [*] Great music, a lot of tracks stick in my head, the battle track can get really annoying though\n [*] Creating builds for different classes and gearing them out is very fun, you can retrain your character pretty much whenever you want for relatively cheap \n [*] Upgrading the stronghold is just simple enough to be addicting\n [*] You can choose how active you want to be in combat, the AI is pretty decent and I did use that through most of the game switching parameters for different fights but you can be as meticulous as you want which is great\n [*] The gibs are so fucking satisfying, I cannot describe the quality of dopamine rush you get from literally punching an enemy so hard they fucking explode into bloody chunks \n[/list]\n\n[h2] Neutral [/h2]\n\n[list] \n [*] Combat was chaotic which was very entertaining but very frustrating as well. Never enough to get genuinely angry but 90% of the fights came down to positioning. The games health mechanics and cheap camping supplies balance this out so while it is messy it is still satisfying\n [*] Woedica is a really funny name to say if you say it super loud like a producer tag, I stimmed hard on yelling that name in my apartment over and over again and I laughed my ass off every fucking time\n [*] The game didn't really need any crafting or alchemy, I managed just fine barely touching these mechanics at all, but they are there for those that want to partake\n [*] Exploration is just fine\n[/list]\n\n[h2] Negative [/h2]\n\n[list]\n [*] Pathfinding and positioning can be a struggle, there were many times when a character would circle the battlefield doing nothing or get stuck behind a teammate. Sometimes I would have to reposition by literally randomly clicking around until all the characters could reach an enemy\n [*] I would have appreciated easier access to unique loot or just more of it, this seemed sparse in my playthrough. The prices for unique items are prohibitively expensive for early-mid game, especially if you have a full roster. It becomes very easy to amass money as you progress but by the time you have enough money to splurge on these items a lot of them are useless.\n [*] I ran into some bugs in the late game, nothing game breaking but annoying nonetheless. At one point I was able to walk through a wall and trigger a story event and I had to reload my save but that was as intrusive as it got\n [*] There were so many spells and damage types that didn't seem necessary for the length of the game and depth of battle BUT this might be something that flourishes under harder difficulties, I just played the game on normal\n [*] Though I ended up absolutely loving the story, it is a slow start, I had a hard time caring about what was going on until a few hours in. \n [*] Traversing the world can be a gigantic pain in the ass, you can only fast travel out of an area when you reach the edge of the map so there is a lot of pointless walking around. This is fine for the first trip to a location but when you're jumping between places rapidly for quest reasons, etc. it gets infuriating having to drag the map to the edge and clicking on the compass to fast travel and then just waiting for an entire two minutes for the characters to make their way there every single time. There isn't enough content density in the world to justify the amount of walking around. \n [*] There needs to be a way to turn off the Kickstarter pledge content as I would sometimes forget and running into it would frequently ruin the immersion. The Kickstarter pledge NPCs were fun for flavor but it got extremely annoying to run into them at almost every corner of every populated area when I was just looking for quests.\n[/list]\n\nIf I had to come up with a score without involving personal bias about the themes of the story that really connected with me, I'd say it's like a B- at its best and a C- at its worst. \n\n[h1]Why this game matters to me personally and the very positive effect this game has had on my life as a victim of religious abuse[/h1]\nLike I mentioned before I could probably go for hours about how this game parallels the things I am currently going through as I recover from the hell that was being a Jehovah's Witness. This game's narrative delves into these topics, the nature of consciousness, the fate of the dead, the moral limits of religion and science. It made me think about how I want to progress in my life and who I am capable of forgiving, and ultimately what to do with this grief and rage. It reached a deep part of me and has helped me understand the depth of trauma I faced. It also provided something of an outlet for that rage. I cannot say that about every game I have played, this one really reached deep. I won't go into specifics as, this review is long enough, but if you have faced the same trails in life and love CRPGs and want to unpack those questions then this game will surely help you process those feelings.

If you\u2019re looking for deep and well-thought-out gameplay, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed, unless you\u2019re a big fan of Ubisoft\u2019s typical formula. However, if you love immersing yourself in an atmospheric world with engaging stories, this game could be a solid choice.\n\nOne major strength of the gameplay is the variety of weapon types, each supporting different playstyles. You also have a lot of freedom in how you approach missions, which is refreshing. However, the mechanics as a whole are rather shallow and lack depth. Players who prioritize intricate gameplay and well-designed enemies might find it lacking, especially when it comes to the few boss fights, which are neither particularly challenging nor creative. As such, the game is more tailored to casual players. Even though I played it on \"Hard,\" I never felt it offered any real challenge.\n\nWhere the game truly shines is in its worldbuilding and the stories it tells. The world feels authentic and alive, making it a joy to explore and learn about the lives of its inhabitants. The only real drawback is the connection to the \"Assassin\u2019s Creed\" franchise, which feels misplaced and out of place. It frequently pulls you out of the otherwise captivating world. A completely new IP would have been a far better approach than trying to reboot the \"Assassin\u2019s Creed\" series in this way.\n\nThis is arguably one of the best games set in an ancient world, showcasing just how much potential this kind of setting holds. Exploring the world feels refreshing and captivating, adding a unique charm to the experience.\n\nAnother major positive is that Ubisoft\u2019s typical open-world formula is entirely optional here. You\u2019re not forced to grind through it. While it provides resources and new weapons, you can safely ignore it if you wish. The game gives you enough to progress without needing to \"check off\" everything. You can simply do what interests you and leave the rest behind.\n\nOverall, this game is aimed at players looking for a relaxed experience with engaging stories, rather than hardcore gamers seeking challenges and complex gameplay. I bought the game at a steep discount and found it quite entertaining for the price. However, I played it more casually, as the gameplay was too simplistic to keep me engaged for long sessions.

A job well done recreating ancient egypt, one of the best protagonist the franchise ever made. Gameplay is good and fun, a fine story and compelling characters. DLCs are really good, visually stunning, challenging boss fights and side activities are not bad. Good soundtracks too.\r\nGame is rewarding and the choice of weapons are also good.\r\n\r\nCons,\r\nIt isn't a classic AC game like it's predecessors. Even though the stealth is fine didn't felt like you are an assassin. Side missions are ridiculous. There are lots and lots of side missions in the game in which atleast quarter of them are truly unnecessary. Like even after you reach the max lvl you can achieve there are still lots of side missions left...duhh !! Also they can get repetitive ( except dlc side missions cuz they are good ) after playing a few, which gets used to through progression. It's open world but there isn't much interaction you can do or in fact any. Some funny things are Bayek beats spiderman when climbing and the mount doesn't mind jumping from heights and still manages to dust off and be on it's way.\r\n\r\nFinally the game is worth spending time on and ubisoft is worthy of your bucks on this one. \r\nOverall the game is a close 9/10 thanks to it's DLCs.", "hours": 6696, "hoursAtReview": 6696, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734157953}, {"text": "unplayable on windows 11 crashes before you can even play the game", "hours": 31, "hoursAtReview": 31, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732796169}, {"text": "DO NOT BUY!!!

While its galaxy of possibilities shines bright, its flaws often pull you into a void of tedium. Average gamer? Not recommended for the average RTS gamer.\n\n[b]Endless Space \u2013 A Real Razor Review[/b]\n\n[b]The Good: Depth, Options, and Gorgeous Stars[/b]\nEndless Space is what happens when someone decides to cram every 4X dream into one game and then balance it surprisingly well. The tech tree alone feels like a buffet, offering four sprawling branches\u2014each packed with dilemmas about what you\u2019ll neglect while pursuing your empire's destiny. Whether you\u2019re terraforming poisoned desert worlds or designing custom battleships, the sheer number of choices is impressive.\n\nThe galaxy generation options are equally flexible: pick a race, create your own, tweak win conditions, or just build a sprawling cosmic playground. And let\u2019s not ignore how visually stunning the game is. The sleek interface and star systems make it a treat for anyone who\u2019s ever dreamed of dominating the cosmos.\n\n[b]Combat: Fast, Smart, but Impersonal[/b]\nFleet battles in Endless Space are quick, clocking in at two minutes per fight, and strategically hands-off. You issue three broad commands (long-range, mid-range, and close-range tactics) and watch the carnage unfold in cinematic glory. Some players will love this streamlined approach; others will feel like they\u2019re playing Pokemon TCG in space. \"I\u2019ll play my engineering card and counter your sabotage card while pew-pew cutscenes play in the background.\" It\u2019s clever and keeps multiplayer fast, but don\u2019t expect the personal, white-knuckle engagements of other RTS or 4X titles.\n\n[b]The Flaws: Tiny Text, Tedium, and Tech-Teetering[/b]\nFor all its polish, Endless Space is far from perfect. Let\u2019s start with the UI design, which feels like it was made for 2012 monitors and hasn\u2019t aged well. Modern gaming setups render the interface so small it\u2019s nearly unreadable, making basic navigation frustrating. It\u2019s not just a minor oversight\u2014it\u2019s a glaring flaw that the developers admit but refuse to fix.\n\nThen there\u2019s the mid- and late-game drag, a classic 4X pitfall. Endless Space may start as a thrilling race for expansion and tech superiority, but once the galaxy is half-conquered, it devolves into a slog. You\u2019ll queue up improvements, end turns, and wait for fleets to shuffle across the map. Micromanaging becomes overwhelming, while automating makes the game feel hands-off to a fault. The result? A lot of clicking \u201cend turn\u201d and waiting for something meaningful to happen.\n\n[b]Tech Extremes and the Cruel Galaxy[/b]\nThe tech system, though robust, can punish players in brutal ways. One wrong branch of research, and your empire is toast when an AI with counter-tech steamrolls your fleets. There\u2019s no way to recover\u2014you either dominate or get wrecked. Fleet sizes are also strangled by arbitrary limits, forcing one-dimensional tactics. Need to invade a system? Hope you enjoy watching fleets fight one at a time while reinforcements queue up for the next 1v1. It\u2019s painfully slow and far from epic.\n\n[b]Endless Tedium[/b]\nAt its worst, Endless Space reduces itself to a waiting game. Ships build. Planets improve. Fleets crawl to their destinations. Rinse and repeat. If you don\u2019t micromanage (and let\u2019s be honest, nobody loves micromanaging 300 turns deep), there\u2019s little to do but skip turns and wait for the next battle.\n\n[b]Verdict: A Brilliant but Flawed 4X[/b]\nEndless Space is a masterpiece of ambition and balance, but it struggles with some glaring issues. For hardcore 4X fans who can overlook the tedious late game and punishing tech extremes, this is a galaxy worth exploring. For casual players or those who value pacing over density, steer clear. It\u2019s smart, polished, and undeniably addictive, but its flaws weigh it down like a black hole in the center of an otherwise dazzling galaxy.\n\n[b]Score: 6/10[/b]\nGreat for masochistic strategy fans.

Shooting just feels intuitive and I feel like I can get a better rhythm for it this time around than in years past. There are some quirks such to the overall feel such as the rim physics, which just seem a bit... off. A lot of shots seem to like bouncing all around the rim even when they're made shots, which always feels a bit bizarre and is not something I remember being so noticable in previous entries. Performance can occasionally be an issue as well. The halftime show with the Inside the NBA guys is locked to 30 fps and seems to have some sort of shader issues, unlike the rest of the game. Make sure to turn cloth simulation OFF in your settings for significant improvements to performance, although even with it off there is an occasional stutter when a timeout is called.\r\n\r\nAlso worth mentioning that the game works pretty decently on the Steam Deck. The graphics and performance are obviously much better when running it off a proper gaming PC, but being able to take the game with you on the go and still get a passable experience is a really nice touch.

I wanted to know what happened and that drove me forwards. It was a bit ubisoft-esque, but offered enough to keep me playing.\n\nWhat happened in Forbidden West that made me dislike it?\n- They nerfed the hunting gameplay. You can only use around 5-6 traps pretty late in the game if you heavily invest in that skill and gear, making that gameplay style obsolete (most of the early game you can only use 3). On top of that, enemies are made more spongy. This causes the combat to be a chore instead of a nice challenge. This ruined the gameplay for me.\n- The story is a mess. Cartoonish villains, one-dimensional characters and Aloy, oh Aloy. Everyone has to tell you she's awesome, because in the cutscenes she isn't anyting like that. Instead of the veteran warrior/hunter she should be (and she is when you're in combat), she is one of the most uninspiring whiny temper tantrum throwing characters I have ever seen in videogame. This ruins the story even more. All side characters are one-dimensional predictable dullards. I didn't care about any of them.\n- The world is way too big with too much generic samy content. It's as boring as the most boring ubisoft games, maybe even more so. It's very pretty looking, don't get me wrong, but it's all just a facade to hide the incredibly boring reality.\n\nI tried so hard to like this game and hoped it would get better. With over 50 hours I really feel I've given it a chance, but now I wish I could have this time back. It's such a shame as the developers are clearly very talented, the games feels polished and looks amazing, it's just so boring and Guerilla Games really needs a good storywriter, because that was just terrible.

The Pokemon aspects are overwhelming, with nothing particularly unique brought to the table in the story or mechanics. I also like that it's not for kids, but it's hard to think of it that why when \"the evil team eats poop\" is a frequent dialog option you can select. Seriously? Eugh. :/\n\n2) No memorable characters. Everyone is a very basic combination of traits, with minimal exploration on what those mean for the characters as a whole. Everyone feels like a cardboard cutout of some particular trope or theme.\n\n3) It's... weird... how often you can misgender characters, or are preached at by the Free Tem people, or how weirdly morally righteous some dialog feels. It feels like this game wanted to tackle bigotry and the moral implications of battling Tems, but does neither in any meaningful way. I could just go on Twitter and have the same dialog from 10k randos. The story doesn't hold my interest at all, either. I don't feel like I can connect with or care about any of the characters. Max is infuriating in away Blue/Gary Oak could never dream of being, for all the wrong reasons. \n\n4) Designs look unfinished. I have this problem with a few games, including Palworld, but some designs just feel like they aren't done. Saku doesn't look like a final evolution. Pigepic doesn't feel like it matches the style of the rest of the game. Raiber looks less like an evolutionary line and more like \"baby, teen, adult,\" with nothing particularly changing about the evolutions to make them unique from one another. The Pahro line is red, green, and pink- that's nitpicky but it's a very strange color combination for a bird.\n\n5) The price feels indicative of an MMO, but the MMO aspects are so toned down that it doesn't at all feel like an MMO. And there's no offline/single player mode. Why not just have options to connect with groups or servers like Terraria, Stardew, or even Don't Starve Together? Smaller sample sizes, more likeliness for interactions (if that's what the goal is), etc. I'm not super savvy on it, but would that be less of a server load, too?\n\n6) Needs a functional in-game report system where the player doesn't have to be right on top of you. Passed by user \"itouchminors\" and could not report them because of this. (Idc about fiction stuff, that's well known, but I do care about people being nasty and toxic and gross for \"shock value\" or whatever :/)\n\nUltimately, I'm going to continue playing, and I really like the idea behind this game (and have 0 issue with Pokemon/any other game clones/inspired by/parodies/whatever), but it's just not very engaging. The story would need too much of an overhaul to be practical for this game, so I hope the other TemTem stuff focuses more on that! And less on preaching to the player in an attempt to be Black and White 1 and 2.\n\nEDIT: POST ADDITION 10 HOURS (60ish hours)\n\nWow. Who is this game trying to preach to? From the \"tasteless cosplayer\" to the weeb in Chipaku, to the transplant who is almost comically appropriating the culture in Omninesia... They're written like bad caricatures of cultural ignorance, or something you might've seen on forums in 2002 anime boards, in a way that's less than charming. Every time I stop to read dialog it's like I'm back on 2015 tumblr, being preached and yelled at that xyz is badevilwrong. Again, this game isn't made FOR kids, specifically (your character refers to themselves as an adult but are likely under 21, and has plenty of swearing and themes that are teen-and-up in nature.\n\nIt feels like a section of the writing is done more like a callout than a story. Why? What purpose does that serve? All three instances of cultural ignorance (or general ignorance) are completely valid and interesting topics to explore, but the most you can say is \"you're a clown\" or \"belostro eat poop!\" ???? What is this, Twitter? I'm just waiting for an NPC in this video game about fighting monsters to start preaching about the morality of evil drawings next... which is extremely unfortunate. It's no wonder this game didn't catch on in most online subcultures, especially those who have moved away from the tumblr/twitter drama of the late 2010s.\n\nI really like playing this game, but every time I stop to read the dialog, I take psychic damage. :( I honestly can't recommend anyone buy it if they want an interesting or well-written story, nor if they want to join the competitive scene (there's very few players). What's left feels like a great idea, with a beautiful world and so much hard work put into it... but with the soul stripped out of it.\n\nI'm sorry, I don't normally leave reviews like this.

It\u2019s really cheap and worth every penny (as for a [u]potato[/u], duh :P) \n\n[i]Brotato[/i] is a game worth recommending for a newbie in a roguelike genre, because it has settings in which you\u2019re able to choose how hard the actual runs are gonna be. If you have a hard time - lower the settings, easy. Getting bored? Scale the things up! Personally I\u2019m not a fan of that system, but I can appreciate that being implemented in this game. That being said - I woudn\u2019t recommend changing anything there until you will get to the [b]quit point[/b] in your mind (that\u2019s where you\u2019re very close to lose interest in the game or simply dump it)\n\nIf you look at this game you\u2019ll think - [i]Vampire Survivors[/i] or something similar, which is totally ok to compare since they\u2019re based rougelikes, BUT the difference I see is that Brotato and it\u2019s whole system keeps you in a nice and comfy loop. What I mean by that? \nGame is built around hordes of enemies swarming you over and over. Each wave you are getting stronger, which is pretty visible - unlike other games. Lot\u2019s of stats to choose from, they\u2019re neatly packed as primary and secondary \u201cskills\u201d. You can choose from [b]48+ characters[/b] (+DLC) and every one of them is [u]unique[/u], they have theirs pros and cons - which you can build your skills around them. Every single one is fun on it\u2019s own way. What\u2019s beautiful in that system is every character might feel different for each player. Let\u2019s say one will absolutely destroy each wave going up to 31 with Sick, but others won\u2019t get pass 13 wave. [b]Luck[/b] have a big impact here and in the whole game (as a stat, and in general), which is one of the reason that game keeps you engaged, without being frustrating. And it\u2019s one of the biggest pros - it\u2019s the variety of starting attributes. They\u2019ll be with you to the end of your run. You need to understand each character and slowly but surely learning from your mistakes. \nIt\u2019s a constant of an try and error, trying your own strats, what works and what not. Bearing in mind the sheer amount of weapons, items and stats that collectively interact with each other. There\u2019s is no limit of items that you can have on you, which if you\u2019re lucky you can make one hell of a build. You can sell weapons during your runs (in shop) which can lead to a drastic change of your build in a later stage IF you got lucky. Added mechanic of a 6 weapons (12 on one character!) is utterly enjoyable. It goes without saying that weapons have their own PASSIVE stats and they\u2019re stacking with each other (if from same category). You get the feeling? It\u2019s such a great playground for [b]build-making[/b]. Getting your build to finally take shape and being able to see that each wave you run through is actually REALLY fulfilling. Added to that - there\u2019s 6 difficulties to choose from which makes my (and I hope yours) mind tickle when it comes to achieving that on every single character in the game.  You want do a one more run, one more try, maybe now you will get another character and you\u2019ll build it differently or try it again, but with a different approach? Everything comes down to winning, every lost fight is getting you more and more motivated to GET THAT WIN. \nBelow that excitement lays a [b]cat[/b] - curiosity. That is another big thing in this game. You\u2019re killing enemies, leveling up, upgrading gear, buying items - overall getting stronger, but deep in mind I was ACTUALLY curious of what my build is about to become. Constantly questioning my choices - am I going in the right direction? Do I really need this item right now? Maybe I should reroll the shop and bet on my luck etc.\n\nAnd that is [b]ultimatly more fun and satisfying[/b] than VS, in my humble opinion.\n\nI don\u2019t want to summarize this by simply comparing to VS, don\u2019t get me wrong. I did add that only for a context, but the [b]essence remains[/b]. [i]Brotato[/i] is an actual roguelike [b]flesh and blood[/b]. Try it and you won\u2019t regret.

It's totally up my alley, and the story seemed super cool to me. But holy shit, there are just so many problems with this game. First, thestealth is insanely tedious and annoying. The fact that you can shoot out the cameras, only to have them immediately get rebuilt and sound the alarm because you logically thought that when you destroyed something it would stay destroyed, is absolutely rediculous. The whole Pchela repairing robots and cameras mechanic just sucks, and is a total pain in the ass. And like the combat is the exact same. The robots have way too much health, and while the damage they do is pretty reasonable, they are just absolute bullet sponges. And, one of the most annoying parts, is the fact that you keep getting knocked down over and over and over. It seems like every attack from every enemy has the ability to knock you down. It's beyond annoying. I'll be the first to admit I'm not the best at most video games, but my experience goes well beyond that. It's more or less impossible to fight back when you're stuck in a corner unable to move because you keep getting knocked down. \nThe other major issue with this game is the story, and more specifically the ending. Spoilers ahead for the ending, although I promise it's not really worth worrying about. [spoiler] Long story short, the 2 options you are given for your endings absolutely suck. The first option, the one to go after and try to kill Sechenov, seems like and for the most part is the logical and correct option. However, at the end, you learn that it was not Sechenov that was putting you in Limbo and made you kill Molotov, Stockhausen, and Filatova. It was actually Charles. He then goes on this speech about how humanity is inferior and becoming polymer like him is the future and humanity needs to evolve, blah blah blah blah. He then kills Sechenov, and takes control of the Jelly Man, and walks off, roll credits. Now that would've been fine, if they had actually set Charles up as a twist villain, instead of just randomly pulling it out of their ass like they did. There was no hint at all that Charles was plotting to literally destroy humanity in some generic evil villain scheme. I was half expecting him to pull out his latest -inator device and for Perry the Platapus to come out of the corner because this is something that Dr Doofenshmirtz would cook up. But the second option is even worse, that option is to just give up. Basically what you do is pull Charles out of your glove and run off, but you do that before you have any actual reason to suspect Charles of anything. And in the process, you let Sechenov deploy Kollectiv 2.0 and enslave the world or whatever. So you get to choose between the whole world losing their free will and becoming a hive mind, or the death of all humanity at the hands of your friend that was turned into a shitty undeserved twist villain that had literally no build up or anything. It's literally just a bad option and a worse option, there is no even remotely good ending. And that's not to say that everything has to have a good ending, it's just that this one felt so undeserved and just pulled out of nowhere. It felt like the \"bad ending\" in a game that has a good and bad ending, but this doesn't have a good ending. Just a bad ending and a cop out ending.

I explored every nook and cranny for hidden skins or fighters like the Noob/Smoke fight in deception. Here they have implied the most basic ideas from both and COMPLETELY disregarded the love that went into those games. The story of Shujinko really was unique. And this story felt completely reused, using the hourglass as an excuse to redo the tournament again. Nearly the same exact idea with Raiden's Amulet previously. I really want to pay for the Chaos Reigns but havent since I heard how short it really was with lack of content for the price.\r\n\r\n MK9 had the 2v2 fighter mode which TRUMPS over kameo's here. Fight me, the kameo idea is nowhere near as good. They could have added 2v2 online instead. Fight with your friend against 2 other players. \r\n\r\nAll previous games had a Crypt and they completely removed it and got lazy. Making a bowl to melt your gold in. I miss the secrets, the easter eggs and the exploration. Whoever made the call to not put time in here is a bum. Yet another missed mark for exploration and dedication Netherrealm used to give the fans.\r\n\r\nThe servers for towers of time are terrible. I get removed to main menu after getting close to the top of a 7+ fight tower with hard modifiers and  it is extremely frustrating. Im not sure what to do about this...\r\n\r\n Im sure everyone is tired of the mention of Micro-Transactions. But all my mains were blocked behind a paywall this year.

What more can I say about a game that's already highly praised? Balatro is a fantastic twist on the deck-building genre, combining strategy, creativity, and a touch of luck to deliver an exciting and addictive experience. \n\n[h3]Gameplay[/h3]\n\nEach run feels unique, yet at times the randomness can be frustrating, particularly if you get a bad draw early on and it ruins an otherwise promising run. It kinda lies a lot at RNG, but I can't complain about that in a poker game I guess. It may also take time for the game to clearly teach the mechanics to newbies. However, once internalized, the game becomes very enjoyable.  With its endless combinations and unpredictable runs, Balatro has excellent replay value. \n\n[h3]Art and Sound[/h3]\n\nBalatro's simple yet charming art style is great. It has top notch UI design and looks very simple and clear from the player's eyes.The sound design is delightful, with satisfying effects, though the music could use more variety to avoid feeling repetitive during long sessions.  \n\n[h3]The Major Issue with Balatro[/h3]\n\nThe biggest issue with Balatro is how poorly the game teaches itself. The game is very easy to learn for beginners. But to play like a master and beat the game with harder challenges, it's not enough. For example the game never teaches you that you could move jokers and explain how their order works. Same with the cards in hand. It's a very important nuance in high-level gameplay. I spent so many hours without knowing this. \n\n[h3]Conclusion[/h3]\n\nBalatro is a clever and highly replayable game that breathes fresh air into the deck-building genre.

LocalThink (developer of the game) says it himself. The only poker things in the game are poker combinations and overall thematic (small blind, big blind, etc).\n\nYour goal each time is to beat the score which progesively gets higher. You are being dealt 8 (usually) cards out of which you have to play up to 5 to get as best poker combination as possible. You can make a simple 1-card combination stronger than 4-of-a-kind. You can turn your standard deck into not so standards one, with only diamond cards, for example, or 20 Aces. And you also get Jokers, which are essentially trinkets, which change the whole loop of the game (you want to play Flush, but you have only 4 cards of the same suit? There is joker for that). There are 150 different jokers in the game, and they really add a lot of extra mechanics and approaches to it. The game does a really good job playing with these concepts of modifying your deck, changing amount of points you get for different poker combinations, incorporating extra gimmicks and points from all sorts of Jokers. There are just too many different scenarios of how you can make the things to play out. Of course, I've described here only some of the basics and one would need to try the game for themselves.\n\nAnd yes, the game is not exactly easy. Even standard difficulty might take you a lot of time to get your first win. At the same time you cannot say that the game is unfair or there is too much randomness. It is possible to win 99% of games on standard difficulty (if not 100%). Mathematically (and from my own experience) you have plenty of space to maneuver and keep winning game after game. Which is why there are higher difficulties, which are not only about getting higher scores, but present also new unique game mechanics.

However, Balatro completely missed the mark for me. The famous dopamine rush of one more run never happened, it was quickly stopped with frustration. My main gripe with the game is heavy RNG and lack of control. Where other roguelike games offer rerolls, banishes, locks, and seals, Balatro offers nothing. There are rerolls, but they are so expensive that they cannot be reliably used for deck building. On higher difficulties, most runs end up restarted after a few blinds because of this. You need to play the cards you get, not the cards you want. In some roguelites, you are free to play whatever build you want, like Vampire Survivors. In others, you also need to play the cards you get, but you can heavily influence what you get, like Against The Storm. That game is probably responsible for my displeasure with Balatro. Against The Storm also has its RNG moments, but it gives you plenty of solutions. With its slow difficulty curve, you will naturally master the game and even the highest difficulties can be reliably beaten. In comparison, Balatro feels like the type of game, that you play while sitting at the toilet.

I tried searching \"Blatro bad game\" and \"I didn't like Balatro\" and the results are \"I love Balatro so bad\" or \"I didn't think I would like Balatro this much\".\r\n\r\nWhat I think a video game should be/what I like is to solve challenges, either by making decisions or mechanics. Balatro has neither of them, and is boring in a frustrating way.\r\n\r\nThis game is a \"strategy game that looks like a casino\". What they forgot to tell you is that it's actually a casino pretending to be a strategy game that looks like a casino:\r\n- When you first launch the game you will think: \"Oh this is really cool I have to make a decision whether I want/have to greed for better hands, or go for something that's easier to make\". No, you don't. Once you buy your first jokers/planet card (those upgrade specific hands) you will effectively be locked into that particular hand for the rest of the run. If you want to go for any consistency, the entire way through you will play pairs, two pairs, and high cards, maybe a flush if you feel fancy. There are no other hands you can realistically expect to repeat in a standard deck. Making pairs out of playing cards is not very fun and you can buy a deck of cards much cheaper if you want to do that instead. It is less bad on low difficulties, but if you care about optimal play you are doomed anyway.\r\n- \"So if the battle has zero decisions/thinking involved, maybe at least the shop does?\" Not really, If you decided that your life belongs to the High Card Jail, you buy whatever jokers support that playstyle, and it's not hard to figure out. There are jokers that give you consistent results and you buy them. Planet cards require no thought. Exception are tarot cards, especially the ones you can play during a fight. Those allow for deck interaction, and there's a limited number of situations where you have to think before you clik a button, however:\r\n- Difficulty scales in the worst possible way for a game to scale: game gives you less hands, less discards and less gold in shops. All of these things remove already small amount of decisions that you have in this game. Less discards? I guess you play High Cards and Pairs, hope you have fun. Less gold? You probably can't afford to buy those fun tarot cards, because all your money is to be spent on the jokers that give you more power. It turns the game into a restart fiesta, where you go into the first shop or two, and then press restart because you didn't get any of the things that make you win the game, and if you win the joker gamble you reward is playing high card for the next 20 minutes or so, yaay.\r\n\r\nI like the presentation of this game, it has a great vibe, but it is nothing but flashing lights.

I\u2019ll admit, I got sucked in by the GOTY nomination hype (even though those awards are a joke), but now that I\u2019ve actually played it, here\u2019s what I think:\n\nThe gameplay boils down to poker hands and making numbers go up. That\u2019s it. Big number beats bigger number. Cards make numbers even bigger. Yay.\n\nJokers, Tarot cards, and other mechanics add a little variety, but the core loop is still just a dressed-up version of the poker minigame from New Super Mario Bros..\n\nRepeated runs are crucial to unlock new cards and decks, which is fine in theory, but losing a run gives you nothing except the items you happened to unlock during that run. A system to spend leftover money on unlocks would be a great QoL improvement.\nBoss Blinds are frustrating. Some are minor annoyances (e.g., debuffing a suit), but others feel outright unfair (e.g., drawing cards face-down or randomly losing cards). It\u2019s all luck, which makes it more aggravating. Seeded runs help, but you can\u2019t unlock anything in them, so what\u2019s the point if you\u2019re still progressing?\n\n$14.99 feels steep for what\u2019s on offer. I get that it\u2019s an indie game and the dev put a lot of work into it, but it feels overpriced for such a small-scale concept. A demo with three Antes and a few unlocks would\u2019ve been a great way to showcase the game.\n\nI can see it being a decent pick-up-and-play title, especially with the mobile port, Steam Deck compatibility, and tiny file size (~70 MB). But I don\u2019t understand how people sink so much time into it. That said, I\u2019d love to see the dev expand on the concept with other card games like Solitaire, War, or Blackjack, bundled into a party pack alongside the poker-based gameplay.\n\nTL;DR: Some games hook you instantly, others take time to grow on you. Balatro has its appeal, but I don\u2019t think it justifies the overwhelming praise. Simplicity can be a strength, like in Tetris, where everything serves the core gameplay.

Two I then started, mostly enjoyed, got to the mid game roughly, and then took a break for a year to come back to.  While two definitely improves on some things that the original had,  I think it took quite a few missteps.  \n\nThe Good\n1. 300 by default cap is great,  I still wanted more as this was easy to hit in mid game, but it was great.\n2. Being able to train higher classes without having that class is very nice, forgiving possible mistakes or bad luck.\n3. The island has multiple floors allowing for lots of building space if needed.\n\nThe Bad\n1.  I really don't like the decision of the guys you send to the map never coming back.  It has you churn through minions and not really care about them because they can quickly and effortlessly be replaced.\n2.  The quest system and having to only be able to work one at a time (one main and one side quest) slows down the gameplay for no real foreseeable reason.  For explanation with the mid game to completion I just had the game running at 2x speed the whole time and would just click to either hire minions or send them out to things.  Not much honestly changed at that point besides clicking buttons to progress honestly.\n3.  The decision to not be able to build outside of the island.  I LOVED the original one with being able to build fake huts, having the agents running around the island and trying to do things.  Having multiple fake entrances filled with diaboloical trap combos.  Here you have two entrances really,  the main one where tourists come in and the helicopter one,  this is the one 95% of the enemy agents come through,  you can't do anything about them besides put traps and cameras along this entrance.  Same for the front entrance the 5 percent of the time they come from there.  It's just so disappointing because all I ended up doing was relying on my security to take them out as I came in,  then minions replacing them to prepare for the next wave.  I really didn't have any notable threats or events happen to me that required some fun creative thinking.  The traps themselves can get disabled now by agents which is also lame and makes them seem a lot less useful than before.\n\nOverall it's really a strong start, but a disappointing ending to this,  I miss the first one.", "hours": 1417, "hoursAtReview": 1417, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732474815}, {"text": "Two things to understand about the early ratings:\n\nMany of the players who played the 1st game wanted a 100% sandbox experience, instead of this one which was largely narrative driven.  Just like the Campaign is the way to play Tropico 4, the narrative is the way to play this game.  It works.  Don't let that detract you.\n\nSecond, the way global missions work was overhauled.  Gold was harder to come by when the game first launched, and now it is a bit......TOO easy to fill your vaults.  Morale was also impacted way too harshly for having dead bodies around the base.  I believe that was a bug, and it was fixed, but those ratings often never change as we all know.\n\nIf you are okay with narrative driven base builders in the vein of Tropico 4, give this game a try.  It's not perfect, but it is a unique, fun, and engaging experience, with decent replay value due to the 5 different Geniuses and 4 different hideouts.  The voice acting isn't perfect, but it is very high quality.  The side missions see all the geniuses having the same dialog, and it gravitates around what Max and Ivan would say.  I would play those two when trying to get achievements they can all get like every Henchmen and every Loot item.  But their main stories are all voiced well enough (Maybe Polar is a little weak, but I've seen people who like her the most so........)\n\nThe initial model to the game didn't actually favor what they wanted to do this game enough, which was intended to be one where it went for several years with several seasons with lots of different additional minions, loot side stories, henchmen, hideouts and geniuses added.  But when you look at Polar and her DLC, it's clear they didn't structure it properly.  With that said, even with only a quarter of the addition content this game was wanting to do, I would consider it rather complete as it landed.  Even at it's listed price of $60 for the deluxe addition with net you 100s of hours of play (more if you are like me and watching an infant so the game runs while you are tending to the baby lol)\n\nThis comes highly recommended as a unique experience.  The game could have easily been better in a myriad of ways, so people playing this game and showing there is a market for it may get us the 3-4 different directions someone could take a game like this.\n\nImagine a game where you are playing Cobra Commander!!

This keeps the co-op gameplay immersive and justified which is always something you worry about when Multiplayer is added to a Single Player game. It manages to maintain the dark, body horror unsettling atmosphere that defines the series.\n\nAt its core, the gameplay loop is simple: you enter a trial, complete various tasks, then are granted the ability to escape - all while more and more enemies spawn. Within the maps; there are tasks like the radio frequency finder which is more then just get item A for location B - however most of the time it feels like the minigame is find X Randomized Key in X randomized location.\n\nThe level design is excellent, rewarding players who learn the maps and master their layouts. Randomized elements\u2014like door placements and item locations\u2014keep each playthrough fresh, and one thing I enjoy is that the difficulty curve changes based on player count so you can enjoy the game alone if you want the original Outlast feel.\n\nWith that being said; replayability is a strong point. Varied loadouts, rigs, perks, and skills allows the maps you play over and over again to be tackled differently, as well various challenges and developer-led events introduce twists. \n\nThe game has \"battle passes\" but unlike some ingame monetization aspects; I found this one respects the player\u2019s time, with fair rewards for playing the game, good cosmetic unlocks and incentives to keep playing even after freeing your character.

I've heard many times that the original had a great story, and here, the remake retains the main points. Most events feel justified, but some parts have been cut or reworked to make the story feel more \u201cHollywood-esque,\u201d which causes it to lose some of its depth.\n\nTommy Angelo, the protagonist, feels like another Mary Sue. He\u2019s the best driver, the best shooter, and somehow survives everything thrown at him. He\u2019s responsible for killing hundreds of people, but shows real emotion or guilt only once every 6\u20137 missions. At one point, he\u2019s horrified by the death of innocent people, but shortly after, he\u2019s back to mowing down cops and anyone else in his way. I really sympathize with this character, I do. I sure don't want to see him paying off for all the atrocities he's done, don't want to see him killed because of all of the funerals he's arranged by his doings. I really like Tommy Angelo, it's literally me! I think you got general feeling.\n\nMoving to mechanics. The gameplay is fine, but unremarkable. Shooting feels just okay \u2014 good enough to get through the story without much frustration. Driving is enjoyable overall, but the infamous race mission is &@#!. Idk why anyone would've thought adding a race with around-realistic handling will be fun. I've tried it nearly 20 times on Hard difficulty, screwed it and beat on the first try after switching to Easy. I don't see any point why it should be in this game, why it shouldn't be more casual, Tommy is not a goddamn Dominic Toretto.\n\nThe visual and environments are the things you can praise Hangar 13 in this remake for. It really feels great to ride on the streets of United States in the thirties of the past century, to hear and see all of this news that were relevant there (newspapers, radio), Music, outfits, general feeling \u2014 amazing.\n\nTo conclude and TL;DR: I rather do not like this game. I've played a lot of different actions and this one, though having a story with solid foundation, fails to evoke any complex emotions in me. The only good part is after completing this remake I want to try the original after a couple of years, when the memories of story will wear off.", "hours": 619, "hoursAtReview": 619, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733175764}, {"text": "My favourite game as a child...\nEverything is great here... even after so much time.

I haven't played it on the release and pretty much I'm new to all of COH games, so consider my review as of someone from an outside of fandom perspective. And also I never leaned towards competitive aspect of RTS games. So yeah, if you're into multiplayer, balance around it and meta than this review might be not for you.\r\n\r\n[b] Difficulty [/b]\r\nIn CoH2 it felt like easy makes AI brain dead, and standard is just very challenging, no inbetweens. But CoH3 made it just right to enjoy and have a bit of challenge for me personally. I have less of situations where my squads been vaped out off screen. Early recon vehicles became more fragile and less of a pain to counter (CoH2 has this problem of having vehicles hard to counter very early in the game). Vehicles overall feel more balanced, like there are less of them, and they are less armoured, but nonetheless they have very good punch and can turn the tide of battle very quickly without but not OP. For a casual player like me it's a very satisfying game to play.\r\n\r\n[b] Presentation [/b]\r\nMaps are delightful to look at, some of them feel like they finally have the sense of elevation and this diorama-like feel. I can't imagine how hard it was to make such beautiful environments. Units look good, I love this almost valve-like style of units. Everything feels expertly crafted, all vehicles and interactions have punch and very satisfying to look at. I have some sort of difficulties to read detailed environments with a lot of moving parts, but this game haven't bring me none of those problems.\r\n\r\n[b] Grain of salt [/b]\r\nSometimes it feels like developers have a reasonable fear to alienate all the fans of the previous games, so they left some archaic mechanics like base building (fortification structures are fun tho). Now you don't need engineers to construct production facilities which is a nice attempt at streamlining the base building aspect of the game. But at this point placing your HQ structures has close to little effect on the gameplay so making building menu in a same fashion as battlegroup abilities menu would help. The grid GUI layout of unit orders, buildings, abilities smashed together in this warcraft 3 like square is another archaism. When most of MOBA's and RTS' are moved away from that, CoH3 stays loyal to that old layout for some reason. Well, at least camera can be finally bind towards WASD, that's a very nice change, but I think more can be streamlined. I wish game had more narrow and focused maps for folks like me who have difficulties to concentrate, and/or wish to constantly look at how battlefield unrolls, or some kind of low intensity mode with one point tug of war-like gameplay.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, despite all aforementioned above game is uniquely fun if you're looking for some ww2 themed rts.", "hours": 829, "hoursAtReview": 443, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734196457}, {"text": "A little pricey, but fun.\n\nMain single player campaign was overambitious, when something more simple like the Ardennes Campaing DLC from 2 would have sufficed.\n\nRecommend if on sale or you have the money to spend", "hours": 5190, "hoursAtReview": 5105, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733947032}, {"text": "Great game, will improve with time as the first and second of the franchise did.", "hours": 8807, "hoursAtReview": 8302, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733178058}, {"text": "coh2 is better in every way.

However, I wasn\u2019t particularly drawn to Backpack Battles at first glance. The images didn\u2019t fully capture my interest, and I hesitated to give it a try. But once I downloaded the demo, I was hooked almost instantly\u2014it\u2019s one of those games where you quickly realize how brilliant it is once you actually play it.\r\n\r\nThis weekend, I wasn\u2019t feeling well and had to skip my usual plans. Normally, weekends are for partying, but being sick gave me the perfect opportunity to try this game, and wow, do I not regret it! What started as a way to pass the time turned into a full-blown addiction.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is genius in its simplicity yet incredibly deep in its execution. The core mechanic of organizing your backpack, strategically placing items, and building synergy between weapons and gear is utterly captivating. Every decision matters. Should I focus on maximizing damage output, or do I prioritize defensive items to outlast my opponents? The depth of strategy here is astounding, and the satisfaction of creating a well-synergized build is unmatched.\r\n\r\nThe pacing is another highlight\u2014runs feel quick, snappy, and engaging. You\u2019re never left waiting, and the action is constant without feeling overwhelming. Playing against other players takes the experience to a whole new level. The competition adds layers of excitement and unpredictability, making each run feel like a unique challenge. The thrill of testing your build against others is exhilarating, and now that I\u2019ve mastered my strategy, I\u2019ve managed to win 7 out of my last 8 matches. Few things in gaming are as satisfying as seeing your hard work and planning pay off like that.\r\n\r\nThe presentation, while simple, is surprisingly charming. The visuals aren\u2019t flashy, but they have a clean and polished look that grows on you the more you play. Similarly, the music\u2014though somewhat repetitive\u2014has a catchy and endearing quality that fits the game\u2019s tone perfectly.\r\n\r\nThat said, it\u2019s clear the game is still in early access, and there\u2019s plenty of room for growth. Right now, it does feel a bit bare-bones, with limited content and features compared to what it could be. But this isn\u2019t a criticism as much as it is an opportunity. The foundation here is rock-solid, and if the developers stay committed and continue adding content, Backpack Battles has the potential to become one of the greats in the genre.\r\n\r\n", "hours": 1253, "hoursAtReview": 817, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731848619}, {"text": "I liked targeting a build and going for it.

The Breach mechanism deprives you (to a large extent) of carefully approaching, planning and executing. It cuts out the 'boring parts'' and reduces the game to a string of encounters where you basically have work with the circumstances you were thrown into. Your soldiers very often get hurt during this fase and you simply cannot do anything about it. Also, I've entered levels where I immediately fulfilled an objective, just by entering the room. The timeline feels very restrictive to me.

Game also allows players to pad out for extra missions.\r\n\r\n[b]Game Review:[/b]\r\nI found myself looking for a grounded but casual tactics game that didn't require a lot of upkeep. Since X-COM 2's the more hardcore and complete experience and there's a mixed reception surrounding X-COM The Bureau, I decided to opt for Chimera Squad instead since I figured it would just be focused on street-level terrors with a hint of alien tech and magic. \r\n\r\nAfter two campaign playthroughs, the TLDR is that Chimera Squad delivers on having an addictive core gameplay loop with enough depth to make a normal twenty hour playthrough enjoyable. But that's about all the positives I can give it. \r\n\r\nIt's still marred with graphical bugs and a few glitches that forced me to reload a save. They won't ruin the experience but I'd like to think of this as a dirty restaurant: the food's great but you can't help but notice all the dust and grime scattered around. You'd usually see characters freeze in the middle of their animation before teleporting to their square a few seconds later, which ruins IRL momentum. Worse instances involve the ceiling suddenly spawning back in and blocking all but the silhouettes, or a combat scenario being permanently stuck in slow motion via Overwatch skills because the weapon's fire animation wouldn't play. \r\n\r\nGraphically, Chimera Squad looks like it's a game from a decade ago and despite being an offshoot of X-COM 2, it doesn't seem to want to use the strengths your characters have. Every interaction leans heavily on backpatting and HR-approved dialogue. What little banter they get into is easily forgettable because the heroes have little bearing on the story. They might make a comment about how X is their clone or that they once worked/fought with Y faction before, but there's no personal stakes in this that you'd wonder why they bothered making the characters if they're just a slight cut above the randomly generated soldiers from the previous games. \r\n\r\nWith all this said, why do I recommend it? Because as a video game, it delivers what I wanted from it. It's a grounded sci-fi special operators tactics game, or X-COM lite as most people refer to it. I don't regret what forty hours I spent in it and you can install mods in this easily.

Battletech is, IMO, one of the best RTS games of all time. If youre hungry for an xcom style tactics game, I strongly suggest you check it out.\n\nBattletech has tons of replay-ability thanks to procedural contract (mission) generation and a pokemon style 'gotta get 'em all' drive for mech collection and experimentation. On top of this, the main story is both long and substantial. It is linear, but the voice acting, 2d comic book style cutscenes, and handcrafted missions make it enjoyable the one or two times you play through it. Mercifully you can start new careers in freeplay, you lose out on some of the story mode 'gimmies' like money and cool mechs but that just adds to the challenge of the pokemon aspect. Flashpoints and other custom missions are added in the DLC which give you more short but fun story driven quests. These are enabled even in freeplay, though AFAIK none of them lock you into mission chains or timers like the main story can. If youre a fan of Battletech Table Top this is ALSO a real must buy. Mechwarrior is cool and all, but this version is the table top ruleset (modified slightly for the digital format). If youre curious about Battletech, perhaps you've seen 40k communities posting memes about it, this is probably the best lore introduction AND gameplay introduction for the series. You wont learn the rules persay, you need a program like Mekworks for that, but you get the sense. \n\nBeyond all this, the modding community is fantastic. Rougetech and Battletech 3062 are elite. Rougetech is, in terms of work done and new content added, up there with Thrawns Revenge & STALKER Anomaly as one of the best, most lovingly crafted, mods I've ever played.  Because these mods add to the pokemon gameplay loop, they are also eminently replayable with thousands of new pieces of tech to collect and build with. Just be warned, Rougetech is not Mechwarriors who panic when the heat gauge starts to tick up. \n\nThe greatest shame is that we are unlikely to see a sequel as the design team was broken up following the launch of the last DLC. Unfortunate because if this game needs two things, its improvements re: stability and performance and more vanilla content (particularly mission types, maps, random event procs) which mods could build on.

A magnificent soundtrack that elevates the experience with a few tracks that will stay with you forever. What a game. Absolutely Loved it.\n\nRagnar\u00f6k is an almost perfect game, I don't think perfection is something you can achieve but at the least, this game is perfection-adjacent, it really feels like a sequel to GoW2018 and a sequel to that, the story will keep you on your feet the whole way through and will not let you down, and unlike the previous game, this time there are tons of new characters and story lines that will keep you glued to the controller even once you finish the main story, I do recommend doing all the side quests before the climax though. \n\nThe graphics have been upgraded quite a bit and while it's not noticeable at first glance, you'll see that this game has so many more details and artistry. Animations also feel more varied and delicately crafted. The story is well paced and feels like a big blockbuster movie, the pinnacle of Sony's narrative focused games, amazing acting by the whole cast and will definitely make you cry. \n\nCombat has been expanded and feels as brutal as always, there's a few sections(don't want to spoil it but) they are a bit different to previous God of War games yet I like how they handled it, it felt like a challenge and was pretty fun.\n\nIn conclusion, a must buy, wouldn't recommend it on it's own however, definitely play the 2018 one.

I'm a huge fan of the franchise. I played FP 1 for more than 200 hours, I played this one for 50 h and I stopped after the first play-through of the story and one endless mode level.\nThis game is not bad at all, it looks and sounds posh, but for me it lacks the \"soul\" of FP1. It does not reach the epicness and \"despair\" of part 1. I try to elaborate on why:\nFP1: After barely making it through the challenging scenarios I felt positively exhausted that I made it and it gave me a sense of accomplishment. When I couldn't save enough people, I played it again to do better.\nFP2: I played it through and I was left with a sense of \"that was it?\" No reason to play on, after I found out how everything works and there won't be anything new to explore, build etc., just endless micromanagement.\nFP1: Managing one city was fun but still challenging.\nFP2: I liked the idea of creating colonies, to build new cities. But hopping between your colonies feels more like work than fun, because you always have to transfer resources or colonists,\nFP1: I really cared for my inhabitants, probably because there were so few and they were more \"visible\" to me. 1 died of frost and I felt bad that I was too slow in increasing the heat.\nFP2: 200 people died somewhere, I didn't know where and honestly I didn't care much because of the automatic population growth and the sheer number of my population. And they are somehow an \"invisible\" mass.\nFP1: Political decisions were felt throughout the level and were always painful.\nFP2: At the beginning I liked the idea with the factions and the council. Later in the game it was absolutely unnecessary to continue to vote in the council when I reached all of them tolerating or liking me and no new laws were there to vote on or I simply ignored them with no repercussion.\nFP1: Reasearching felt more urgent. It was difficult to decide what to research next, everything felt necessary and important to have.\nFP2: I left out several research, some didn't feel important and it wasn't. I left out the radical ideas completely because they felt too harsh, no problem at all, no repercussions.\nFP1: Exploring the frostland felt tougher and resources scarcer to find as it should be in a wasteland.\nFP2: Send out 50 people in every direction and find loads of resources, cores and people to rescue. Rinse and repeat till all lands are explored, so you can stop playing, nothing new is coming.\n\nAlso, the idea with the districts: What do I really need them for? It just restricts my idea of building the city,\nAnd what is the sense of frostbreaking the terrain? Honestly, what is it for? Where is the fun or danger in it?\n\nIn the end I kinda liked FP2 but only for a short time, much shorter than FP1 unfortunately...", "hours": 3158, "hoursAtReview": 3158, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731801015}, {"text": "Frostpunk 2 isn't 'First game but better', it's a whole new game.\r\n\r\nYou aren't playing with a few hundred people, you're playing with tens of thousands.

It introduces new factions and systems that only add unnecessary complexity without enhancing the experience. The joy of researching and building new technologies, which was one of the highlights of the first game, is significantly diminished because you\u2019re constantly caught up in managing endless crises. The faction system, while mildly interesting, becomes an exercise in frustration as you\u2019re punished no matter what decisions you make. Instead of feeling like your choices matter, it\u2019s just an ongoing battle to keep everyone placated, making it hard to progress.\n\nThe game also piles on micromanagement with manpower allocations, but no matter how much effort you put into balancing resource consumption and fulfilling needs, you\u2019re always out of balance. This constant struggle detracts from the fun of building and growing your city. On top of that, the passage of time and weather conditions\u2014important factors for achieving objectives\u2014are made unnecessarily difficult to track with the new time and weather indicator, which is clunky and hard to read compared to the simple and intuitive system from the first game.\n\nPersonally, I found the new zone-drawing mechanic to be a step backward. The game automatically populates the zones with buildings, which is reminiscent of SimCity, but it feels less engaging than the hands-on approach of building individual structures. The research trees hold some interesting ideas, but they become irrelevant since you\u2019re too busy micromanaging resources, people\u2019s needs, and emotions to get any meaningful progress on them. This makes the research system feel like a wasted opportunity, and the sense of accomplishment that came from unlocking new tech in the first game is completely lost.\n\nUltimately, Frostpunk 2 feels like a game that loses sight of what made the original so compelling. The constant micromanagement, poorly balanced systems, and confusing interfaces make the experience more frustrating than enjoyable.

That's what frostpunk 1 was - because in FP1 it was obvious you *could* do a deathless hardcore run in more or less any of the game modes while also taking no \"evil\" technologies.

FP2 you can kind of just win games but you are gonna lose some folks and your decisions aren't obviously the cause of that.\n\nIn FP2, it's not clear how that works, and the workforce is so easy to get that there's no clear benefit to doing so.

I adored it so much, that since then I have not only attempted to absorb all Persona-related media I can find, but it GOT ME INTO ANIME BIG TIME, and I have spent THOUSANDS of pounds on manga, as well as bought many anime-or-Persona related figures, gotten four different anime-or-Persona related tattoos, and even went on holiday to Tokyo, with one of the main reasons being to visit Akihabara.\r\n\r\nFor almost ten years, my favourite game of all time has been The Witcher 3.

Everything about it is incredible. This is the most astoundingly stylish media experience I've ever had.

And by some curiosity as a man who enjoys this medium of video game or simply fictional narrative. I tried this game. I seriously gave it the best effort i could. But this shit is so ass!\n\nNot the side content, mind you. If we're mainly talking gameplay or how confident/social link are. This is a persona game, aka it's great. Things like Takemi, Ohya, akechi, the dude you talk mentality with or Makoto (outside main story) are some of the best thing they have to offer.\n\nBut that's the key point. Side things. The aboslute patience you got to have to slug through one of the worst told story i've ever had the missfortune to sit through just to get to the few crumbs of actual good stuff persona game should be able to offer.  It was one thing having to go through the dogsh*t introduction of makoto to the team where she messed up at every step and then the game want to force onto you this idea that she's the biggest brain on the  team when in what dimension can that even be conceived. To the Futaba part where the game take weeks telling you the same thing and slowing things so much because futaba as a character is so ass. To this point i'm at where i'm deciding to just stop, give up, and play etrian odyssey instead. This absolute echo chamber of stupidity when the cat gets one guy by the least credible member of the team as told by the game and then force a \"how can you save people when you can even save your firend\" story that has beyond no ground to stand on if the game WOULD FOR THE LOVE OF EVERYTHING THAT IS HOLY LET ME SPEAK DURING THOSE MOMENT! I'll rather have a more important imput on story relevant stuff then having the game give me three option to describe how i want to imprgnate the teenager that's still recovering from her friend that almost commited suicide.\n\nAnd the flashback. Oh sweet jesus the flashback. Everytime you're starting to interact with a character the proper way because you sure aren't going to find anything good in them through the main f*cking story! Or even when you're getting a decent flow with the story. The game had this idea of forcefully pulling you out of this story so you can partake in a useless segment when you're being interogated by a woman you do not give a sh*t about. They try to justify it by making her a confident but i'll rather them make a character i actually want to interact with then forcing onto me the THIRD forced confident that progresses on it's own.\nThis is, unironically, with the most sincerity you can take from a stranger on the internet. The worst narrative decision i've ever seen. Bluntly.\n\nYes it has takemi, yes it has akechi, yes it has makoto, yes it has ohya, And maybe for some, this is enough to slug through this dreadful main story. But i can't find any excuses to continue this game.

I first learned of it through cozy related videogame channels that focus more on farming sims and similar games. I would not call Luma Island a farming sim, nor would I call it a cozy game. Sure, I find it cozy, but it isn't what you can now expect from the 'genre'.\n\nInstead, Luma Island resembles Valheim, Terraria and Minecraft in its resource gathering and cooperative gameplay loop. You get stuff to make more stuff, but also explore a mysterious place and solve puzzles, overcome challenges and also collect these cute critters called Lumas, for which you'll be collecting more stuff to have them live on your farm with you. The multiplayer is absolutely seamless, works super well, and the solo play is good too.\n\nThe art direction is GORGEOUS. Running through the compact but well designed town is pure joy. The whole game is in that regard. The fact that it's a less obtuse and prettied co-op gathering game helps when filling a gap between more hardcore experiences and the cozier ones. Luma Island isn't particularly difficult, it does respect your intelligence, but it's quite forgiving.\n\nI found the NPCs funny, and I like their sardonic lines. I also like that I don't have to build relationships with the a la other farming sims, just to distance itself a little more from other games, but I would like more quests, more puzzles and all of that good stuff. That said, becoming friendlier with the NPCs and giving them gifts would be cool to, really.\n\nAll in all, I can recommend Luma Island and will continue playing it because it's cute, I love my worm tied to a ballon Luma and my dogs.\n\nFor more reviews of games that are cozy, or creepy, or both, check out my curator page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44079361/\n\nHere are some things I believe would do wonders to enhance the experience: \n\n[*] make some of the crafteables consumable when logical, like food and beverages, and give the player the choice of selling them for gold or consuming them for temporary buffs. I'm annoyed at the fact that I can't eat the food I make.\n\n[*] give the player more customization options, don't gender lock clothing, accessories and facial hair because maybe someone wants to rock a full beard and also cosplay as Sophie from Howl's Moving Castle, let people have their fun in that regard.\n\n[*] make each Luma feel more unique by giving each of them a passive ability. I wouldn't go as far and remove the chest finding ability they all have, but I think that we could have some Lumas make you faster at mining, others faster at fishing, or luckier overall, or better at farming, that kind of stuff. As it stands, while cute, all of the Lumas and pets are practically the same.\n\n[*] more QoL for the inventory, like a 'remove or add' to the quick access bar button/command.

The art is really cute. The music and sound design is *chefs kiss*. However, the game play is pretty lacking. It's basically just a huge busy-work simulator. You'll chop trees, mine ore, collect items to upgrade your tools and professions to progress to the next area where you'll do it all again. That's basically the entire game right now. The only reason I'm continuing is that I want to 100% the game and put it away.\n\nIt actually feels like the more you make progress the less you feel progress. Crafting times and costs start to increase drastically, prices start to hike up and the more you do the less it feels like anything is actually getting done. I just got to the last zone and my tool upgrades went from costing something like 16 000 to now costing 250 000. It's literally insane. Things take forever to actually gather because you've got to sit through things like trees falling over, bushes falling over, the tedious mine lighting and items dropping around what you broke so you need to now run around and gather them. It adds up like crazy when you need hundreds - thousands of a single item.\n\nDecorating your farm, which could use some more flat land please devs, is absolutely yikers. You do not want to spend the materials half the time because they cost so much. You can't move the base caravan to make room for a new house. You have to manually destroy things, piece by piece, if you want to move things. If you accidentally hoe the default pathway you can't replace it in that style. You can only put sand over it which looks different.\n\nThe story and lore is just told to you by nobody statues that you find around the world. They don't just hint at it, they tell you word for word what the story is. I knew what was happening as the penultimate reveal to the story before I even got there. That is the most lame story telling. I hope it gets completely removed or changed because it is so horrendous.\n\nThe NPCs are flat, one dimensional nobodies. You occasionally interact with them for a quest or to hand them your profession upgrade but outside of that - nothing. Honestly, the few times you do interact with them they have too much to say about nothing that I just flicked through it all.\n\nProfessions feel half-cooked.

I played the demo twice soon after it's release with two different professions. Since purchasing I am generally enjoying the game very much however, I have some gripes with how things have changed since the initial demo release. \n\nThe negative:\n- I don't really understand the dev's choice of how they're handling difficulty modes. They said based on feedback they decided to combine the cozy and harder modes into one more balanced mode and removed the lose on death mechanic for the temples and mines. I can appreciate the thought behind this however, I don't think its ever a good idea with a game like this to force all players to play one way. I feel like it would have made much more sense to have added somewhat customizable difficulty settings with the aspects of each game mode: ability to toggle lose on death, adjust combat, etc. \n\n- Another issue I have with the full release is that the villagers don't really seem to have a purpose and as far as I've been able to tell there's not even really a way to increase friendship with them. I understood there being a lack of relationship building in the demo but expected that it would be a part of a full release. \n\n- I am also someone who likes to play games somewhat realistically as it helps immerse me. So, I typically prefer to sleep in game if its an option but the ability to do this seems pointless. There is no energy mechanic or anything that sleeping boosts and with how quickly the days go by it really feels like more of a hindrance than anything else. Why sleep when you can get an extra 8+ hours each night of exploring and progressing with no drawbacks?\n\n- Time also seems to go incredibly fast, this is in no way helped by the fact that the only time when time isn't moving is if you specifically pause the game. It doesn't pause during dialog or when opening menus like the inventory. This when paired with the often very long stretches of dialog from the villagers and lack of any true reason for talking to them, other than curiosity, makes talking to villagers also more of a hindrance than anything else. I found myself going from wanting to talk to all of the villagers and get to know them to still wanting to but choosing not to as all it really does is waste time. It feels like there either needs to be settings for making time move slower and/or a change made so that it pauses at least in dialog and potentially also the inventory menu.\n \nNow the positive:\nI really love the exploration in this game, it truly feels like there's something to discover around every corner and discovering new areas feels amazing and exciting. I also love the idea of the different professions as they really do feel very different from each other and allow you to experience different aspects of the game. I've seen a fair amount of people complaining about the graphics but I personally love the art style of the game. I've also seen a large number of people complaining about the grind of the game and about how long it takes to gather resources but as long as you upgrade your tools it really gets so much better. It provides incentive to prioritize upgrading at the beginning, which I don't think is a bad thing and I feel like is typical of games like this. \n\nOverall, this is the only farming sim type game I've enjoyed this much since Stardew Valley. I am excited to see where this game goes and I hope that the devs keep improving it and add a little more customization with the settings and difficulty so each player can play the way they want to.", "hours": 1049, "hoursAtReview": 255, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732243988}], "name": "Luma Island"}, "209660": {"reviews": [{"text": "This game is not worth $60 today or the day it was released.

I hate this game. I hate this series. I hate capcom. The sheer BETRAYAL. Delete this game from my memory. I'm so done. >:(\n\nOG review:\n\nI'm enjoying the game but I don't think I could recommend it to anyone. \n\nI literally can't use the monsters I want because I'm stuck balancing types and \"movement abilities\" and only have so many slots. Velocidrome is the only damn thing that has jump until mid-late game and it's replaced with just another one of the great jaggi types. If I want my beefy tigrex, I can't make room for the nercylla I want because they both have climb. It's so stupid, my team is full of monsters I don't care about. I thought it would all be fixed when I unlocked fly but it's not even usable once you enter a dungeon area. \n\nIt's the exact same with the weapons. If I use hammer, I can't have hunting horn because I have to cover the three damage types. And each weapon only does one damage type it's assigned. You know what's cool about great sword in the actual monster hunter games? It can do slash AND BLUNT damage depending on what combos you use. You even learn the charge rush maneuver WHICH IS A BLUNT ATTACK. But in this game it still does slash despite that. And then since each individual part has different weapon type resistances that also change depending on what state the monster is in, you gotta constantly swap what weapon your using. It would be a cool system honestly if it didn't completely gimp weapons that rely on stockpiling to use their abilities. The gunlance generally gets one bullet loaded with each attack, two on a won head-to-head I think. But you know what happens by the time I get it fully charged for it's ultimate ability? The part breaks or the monster becomes enraged or what have you and now I have to switch weapons or do no damage. That sucks.\n\nAnd to top it off, a lot of the cooler monsters, you can't actually have on your team for what seems like no real reason. I can have Nercylla (bug) but not Seltas or Seltas Queen (also bugs). I can have Popo or Anklyo (trash mob) but I can't have Hermitaur (cool crab).\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as the first game. Rock-paper-scissors with memorization. The buddy system is cool, there are more monsties, still forced to have Rathalos in your party, etc. \n\nThe UI and the game as a whole feels extremely un-polished. There aren't simple things like being able to sort your quests by ONES YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY COMPLETED. Why would I want to even look at un-repeatable quests I've finished? Much less have them randomly mixed together with the ones I'm actively tracking. The quick travel map is just kind of a list of names without any indicator of where exactly they take you. The villages aren't marked with anything different to indicate that they are villages. You can't mark your own map for things to come back to or view areas you aren't in to figure out where you want to go. The villages are designed to make it take as long as possible to get to everything. \n\nBut by far, the most infuriating thing in this entire game is Navirou. There are no options to tell him to shut the heck up and every single damn time he pops up dialogue, you have to click a button to dismiss it. Which of course leads to stuff like not picking up items because dismissing the dialogue ate your button click as you were walking by. Not getting back on your monstie to run away in time. Not being able to click the catstand to activate it as you walk by because FOR SOME GOD FORSAKEN REASON, HE WAITS UNTIL YOU ARE ALREADY ON TOP OF IT TO TELL YOU IT'S NEARBY. Not to mention EVERYTHING HE SAYS IS INSANELY BASIC AND UNHELPFUL. \n\n\"The monster is asleep! Here's your chance!\"\nI CAN SEE IT. THERE ARE GIANT BUBBLES COMING OUT ITS NOSE AND EVERYTHING.\n\"There's a catstand nearby\"\nYES AND I MISSED IT THANKS TO YOU, STUPID. \n\"I think you've collected all the bottle caps buddy\"\nYeah that's great, I'm currently next to an egg running from a monster and you've prevented me from picking it up and now I'm stuck in a fight thanks.\n\nAnd he repeats all of this dialogue, every. single. time. without fail. I hate him, I wish he would die.\n\n*ahem* So to summarize, the game is fun and a good addition to the monster hunter franchise generally but it misses the mark on creature collecting, gameplay, quality/polish and is just generally annoying.", "hours": 3122, "hoursAtReview": 3121, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732256884}, {"text": "Addicting monster collecting game with a great story.\n", "hours": 4592, "hoursAtReview": 4592, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732721623}, {"text": "fun and intuitive with qol improvements from the first game", "hours": 15115, "hoursAtReview": 10896, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732654131}, {"text": "I had to re-install twice because it would not save the game after I was about level 34", "hours": 7612, "hoursAtReview": 4741, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1733878624}, {"text": "If you like monster hunter and pokemon then this is a goated game", "hours": 3141, "hoursAtReview": 244, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732780178}, {"text": "Very refreshing game, pretty good.", "hours": 2044, "hoursAtReview": 2044, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734288172}, {"text": "Very fun take on the turn based rpg stuff and the monsters are really cool", "hours": 3887, "hoursAtReview": 3887, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734332993}, {"text": "if u like monsters and u want them as pets play this game", "hours": 673, "hoursAtReview": 419, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733206684}, {"text": "Great game!", "hours": 10591, "hoursAtReview": 10588, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734197676}, {"text": "Very fun :D", "hours": 754, "hoursAtReview": 595, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733083417}, {"text": "cool game", "hours": 2338, "hoursAtReview": 2338, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732004500}, {"text": "i love this game", "hours": 3407, "hoursAtReview": 297, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731980021}, {"text": "", "hours": 7280, "hoursAtReview": 3214, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732208551}, {"text": "gg", "hours": 1415, "hoursAtReview": 1415, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733148737}, {"text": "im a mother now", "hours": 3809, "hoursAtReview": 2791, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732457449}], "name": "Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin"}, "291550": {"reviews": [{"text": "Goofy Ah Fighting Game", "hours": 2375, "hoursAtReview": 2375, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733918325}], "name": "Brawlhalla"}, "213670": {"reviews": [{"text": "pros\n-getting probed by aliens was fun and literally gave me the ability to teleport\n-you can have friends in this game\ncons\n-you have to break the gentleman's oath", "hours": 989, "hoursAtReview": 989, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732781624}, {"text": "What a game...

It\u2019s as if I begin to see that spark of innocence again, which seems to fade away with time, but Ori shows me that it\u2019s still very much alive.", "hours": 1212, "hoursAtReview": 1131, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733334955}, {"text": "great platform game, similar style than castlevania and metroid... challenging 2d with lots of abilities and customization", "hours": 481, "hoursAtReview": 364, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1731789135}, {"text": "one of the best metroidvania's I've ever played. movement is top notch, combat is much improved from the first game and the game is just too fun to explore, MOON did a phenomenal job and as unlikely as it is i do wish this series would continue in the future", "hours": 980, "hoursAtReview": 980, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732650111}, {"text": "Beautiful.\n\nI hadn't realized how much I liked platformers until I got the Ori games, and oh boy is this fantastic. The movement system is incredibly fluid; chaining together all of the different abilities is fast and fun. It's fairly approachable, too: you won't be suffering Hollow Knight's path of pain here. There are some optional extra challenges scattered around the map to race between two points, if you want to engage with those. I'd obviously recommend doing so. Oh and, use a controller: analog movement is important.\n\nThere are tons of collectibles scattered around the map, hidden but not absurd. I achieved 95% completion without doing the thing that reveals the location of every collectible, so just being observant is enough (and no, that doesn't mean banging your head against every wall - there's tells). It took about 15 hours to clear everything on hard difficulty for my first time through.\n\nThe escape sequences are the highlight of this (and the previous) game. It really lends itself well to the fast-paced platforming, which is a lot of fun to do under pressure. I didn't have many issues with readability, and it resets quickly enough in case you don't see what you needed to do in time. Coupled with the music, it's a fantastic experience. I don't know if I'll ever hit the high I did when I first did the Ginso tree in Blind Forest.\n\nThe combat in Will of the Wisps is better than Blind Forest, with the sword stopping your momentum so you can float a bit while you attack (by comparison, in Blind Forest you had to figure out how to spam X and A at the same time... not a great experience, but then Blind Forest doesn't have as much combat). I didn't find combat particularly difficult, especially once I acquired the hammer ability - and that's playing on hard (which is more of a health bar increase than actual difficulty). I also didn't think the boss fights were too interesting: part of that is because of the aforementioned health bars, but also because I don't think it exercises the core platforming as much as the escape sequences do.\n\nThe story of this and the previous game is one of the best I've played. You should play Ori and the Blind Forest before this, if that's not obvious for whatever reason. Hard-hitting emotional moments with great, well-fitting music. I don't want to get into the details.

There's a lot of time wasting when viewing memories and strange choices like forced walking which is simply poor design (anything that restricts or slows control is almost universally hated - you might as well just have full motion video at that point to reduce player irritation).\n\nMelee combat isn't particularly satisfying (reach on double handed weapons is barely more than single handed, but drastically greater for mobs for some reason), and performance on PC with a 3080 and 32gig of RAM still has occasional weird stutters.\n\nI'd say that the absolute worst thing for me was the level design.

I guess by that you can say I got what I deserved for being over confident.\r\n\r\nThe game holds up very well, even though it was released in the late 90\u2019s. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s more a testament to the good simple controls of the game, the simplicity of First Person Shooters, my experience with the later Half-Life 2 games\u2026 or some blending of all the above.\r\n\r\nNearly all the controls were exactly as expected with standard WASD controls, crouching with CTRL, Interact with E, Flashlight with F, switch between weapons with the scroll wheel or number keys. \r\nThere were two surprising mechanics I didn\u2019t learn about until the end of the game. First: There\u2019s a \u201cLong Jump\u201d you don\u2019t get access to until the end of the game, where the scientist who gave me the module said \u201chopefully you\u2019ve taken the Black Mesa Training\u201d. NO I HAVEN\u2019T TAKEN THE TRAINING, I THOUGHT I KNEW WHAT GAME I WAS PLAYING! Here\u2019s what you do: While running press crouch and then jump. You can\u2019t beat the game without it.

What follows is a relentless fight for survival against alien creatures, military forces, and strange anomalies. The narrative unfolds seamlessly without the need for lengthy cutscenes, allowing you to experience it through the environment and interactions.\n\nThe gameplay is where Half-Life truly shines.

The pacing is spot-on, keeping you engaged without ever overwhelming you. The variety in enemies, environments, and weapons also keeps things exciting.\n\nWhat stands out the most, however, is the atmosphere. The eerie silence of Black Mesa, the tension in every encounter, and the feeling of being completely alone in a hostile world, all these elements come together to create an unforgettable experience. The AI is surprisingly smart for its time, making encounters unpredictable and exciting.\n\nThe graphics, while dated by modern standards, still manage to impress thanks to Half-Life's art direction. The sound design is equally incredible, with atmospheric noises and weapon effects that make the world feel alive and dangerous. Plus, the iconic \"We\u2019ve got hostiles\" voice lines are etched into the memory of every player.\n\nEven decades later, Half-Life remains a game that\u2019s worth playing for anyone who appreciates great storytelling, challenging gameplay, and an unforgettable experience.

When I first played Half-Life, I wasn't really the biggest fan of it, but more recently (with newfound motivation after the Half-Life 2 20th Anniversary Update), I ended up marathoning the game in two to three days.\n\nEven though I didn't initially like the campaign enough to finish it, I would find myself playing the deathmatch mode in both this game and Half-Life: Deathmatch Source infrequently but repeatedly--I would keep coming back.\n\nI decided to play this again, and I didn't know how far I would get. Once you get into the flow of each chapter and try all manner of techniques and weapons to fight the unique situations the game puts you through, the campaign becomes quite fun. I don't usually like shooters very much, but there is interesting variation in gameplay (you also do quite a bit of platforming and simple puzzle-solving) that it doesn't become too repetitive. All of the weapons in this game are very enjoyable and satisfying to use; as you progress through the game, you'll gain a better understanding of how both the enemies work and how your weapons can interact with them (for example, I initially used the [spoiler]shotgun[/spoiler] on Vortigaunts, but over time, I realized they didn't have so much health that it was necessary, and it was far more efficient to use the [spoiler]magnum[/spoiler]).\n\nIt's definitely more of a personal nitpick, but one part I didn't really like is the game's tendency spawning enemies in front of you and breaking structures as you're passing by them. This is done for cinematic effect, but there are instances where it could get you killed with very little chance for your survival, meaning reloading from a prior save (this game has quick saves, so it isn't too problematic.) There was also one instance near the end of the game where you need to guess which portals will progress you further into a laboratory complex, and if you enter a specific one, the game will instantly kill you with (seemingly) no warning. Since this only happens once in a multi-hour campaign, it's a very minor issue, but I think it should be mentioned nonetheless.\n\n\nIn addition to a campaign, this game also features a multiplayer deathmatch mode. I normally don't focus on these when I'm evaluating how much I like a game, but in the case of Half-Life, the deathmatch is actually very fun (and part of the reason I kept coming back to it)! You will probably be dominated by players who have been playing much longer than you and have all of the weapons in their inventory, but, as previously mentioned, the guns in this game have unique functions between each other, and, more significantly, feel very balanced where you have a chance of surviving most situations (assuming you don't only possess a pistol from just respawning).\n\n\nIf you're considering playing Half-Life, I can highly recommend it, especially since it's usually very cheap on Steam sales. Not only is it an influential game in the first-person shooter genre, but it holds up quite well where I think it's worth at least one or two playthroughs, even today, not to mention the deathmatch mode you can keep coming back to.", "hours": 1425, "hoursAtReview": 1393, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1733330256}], "name": "Half-Life"}, "234140": {"reviews": [{"text": "GIVE US A SEQUEL!!!\r\nSuch an underrated game, yes it can be repetitive with all the camps and scrap locations, but the car gameplay and combat is brutally good.

The grim atmosphere, the bright colors, the wasteland with its crazy characters, Gastown\u2026 it's all there and it's well executed. The story is fine, nothing too original but it's ok. Some sections, in particular those inside the airport and the metro, had a bit of a horror vibe, and reminded me somewhat of the Metro series. Mostly though the game is action focused, with vehicular and melee combat. The first one is a great simulation of the movie scenes, while the on foot part is more similar to the Batman Arkham series combat style, a bit too easy and repetitive even though serviceable. \n\nThroughout the game we will gather resources in order to improve our character and most importantly our car, which is the centerpiece of the show. We\u2019ll have all the fun gadgets we need to dominate the wasteland and bring destruction upon enemy vehicles and camps.\n\nThe main gameplay loop outside of the missions is fine, albeit it could get a bit grindy and repetitive after a while, at least while trying to max out the upgrades. \n\nLocations are well designed, and various as much as they can be in a desert wasteland setting.\n\nThe car handling is good and it changes significantly with any setup change / upgrade.\n\nOn a side note, scattered around the huge game map there are some history relics, which are basically pictures of the past, usually with some captions. Some of those really got under my skin and managed to bring me a sense of dread while reading them because they're so topical to the present day and age, especially those describing the beginning of the end.\n\nI also appreciated the faithfulness to the movie franchise and the reference to the first one (the car which is taken away from Max at the beginning is the one from Interceptor). Also the black finger guy Chum is probably a reference to the limping mechanic?\n\nAside from the overall \u201cgrindyness\u201d of the gameplay loop, the other complaint I have is about the audio, lacking a bit of music (imo) and also suffering from audio compression artifacts when a lot was going on at the same time. Not sure if that was a problem caused by my system / OS (I played the whole game on a Linux Mint system) or it was a game issue, since I read online it had some audio issues at launch.\n\nAll in all then a good licensed video game tie-in, with some really cool set pieces and an overall enjoyable gameplay loop.

Mad Max is a third person open-world game that switches between two game modes. Hand to Hand combat heavily influenced by the Arkham games & vehicular combat. The game is sort of set in an odd place in terms of the timeline but the most collective conclusion is it serves as a prequel to Fury Road. Regardless of that the game is it's own original game in terms of story. While the game first started out as a linear experience the development was later changed for it to become an open world game. \n\nSince Avalanche is best known for the nonsensical and over-the-top tone of it's Just Cause games, Mad Max is toned down to give the world and characters a more serious vibe and playing it completely straight. The open world isn't stupidly huge like Avalanche is known for creating. The main focus of the game or I should say the dopamine kick is upgrading your car and Max. There are a handful of car bodies to choose from and customize choices to create your own death chariot. Max himself can be customized by upgrading his outfit and giving him different beard and hair lengths. One detail I did like is when Max takes damage in hand to hand combat this can result in Max having a bruised & battered face which will show during cutscenes and stay exclusively on his face until the game is reset.\n\nI know an odd thing for people is Max not sharing a likeness with his actor counterparts. Gibson or Hardy (though there is a mod to give him Gibson's likeness if you so wish to do that). Max does have voice acting but he rarely talks to others. You will mostly hear his inner thoughts and self dialogue. I do like how Max truly does feel like a man at his worse. He has nothing left to lose and it really brings out that more brutal side of him in combat. His cynicism and heavy reclusive attitude to help others unless it benefits him as well. \n\nMax's quest is to get to the Plains of Silence to find eternal peace. The Plains of Silence being a metaphor for death. The Plains resemble something of a void that one enters and never returns from. I do like the attitude that Max wants to die on his own terms and refuses to let the Wasteland take that from him.\n\nIt'll provide you a good 30-40 hours of gameplay. I would heavily recommend it especially if you're a Mad Max fan. George Miller went on record saying this wasn't a good game. He is entitled to this opinion but sorry Georgie you're talking out your backside with that one.\n\nFor achievement hunters it isn't too hard to 100%. It is a long road though.

That's a 0.0238095 of that happening but it still manages too. Why isn't stuff like that coded out in the first place? Letting an RNG run rampant would ruin the game, they had to have coded in factors to keep it in check. Why are there so many game ending variables that can't be culled or dealt with. Less than 20% of all people who have played this on just steam have never even beaten the Spire Heart. Personally, if over 80% of your players can't actually beat your game completely, then your game is unbalanced for the average gamer.", "hours": 13403, "hoursAtReview": 13221, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732131952}, {"text": "One of the most well balanced games ever made.

So, your skills do not matter much in this game. If you are fine with this concept, Slay the Spire is a card game that can steal many hours of yours, I can guarantee you that.

That being said, I just finished my first run tonight and just...Didn't really care that I finished it. All I was met with was a screen basically telling me I had to suffer through 2 more times with 2 different characters to get to what I'm assuming is either the \"true\" final boss or another act entirely, which I'm not entirely a fan of. \n\nThere's not a story to follow that I can see. The combat becomes very monotonous and at no time did I ever think \"WOW, THAT WAS COOL\". Once you have the cards you need (whenever they DO decide to show up), you're set so long as the RNG puts them in your hand when you need them, which it rarely does until you're about to die. And then you die and all of the cards you've collected just get thrown back into the void for you to have to collect all over again. \n\nI can understand the appeal of the game. The art is amazing. The characters you play as all have their own unique mechanics (even if the first two are very boring in my opinion). The enemy types are varied enough to prevent the game from feeling completely boring, though I got sick of seeing the same repeat \"elite\" enemies and actively avoided the elite rooms during Act 1 after a time. It's really fun, but it just isn't for me. \n\nBut the game lacks, in my opinion, any incentive to continue playing after you finish the first run. Yes, I know, for some reason there's a competitive scene with the leaderboard and everyone trying to 1-up each other, but really, that's not the appeal of a roguelike in my opinion. The appeal, for me, comes from constantly getting new things. Not finding new things every 5 failed runs. And out of the 3 measly cards you unlock, they may be complete garbage and you'll never actually want to use them. The crazy thing? If you care about 100%ing the game, you'll have to commit time to playing with each of the 4 characters for multiple hours to \"level up\" and unlock the 3 cards for each level up to get EVERYTHING. \n\nNow, moving onto the RNG of this game...It's whack. It's probably the worst RNG I've ever seen in any game that I have ever played. There are times where you'll be breezing through. Not a thought in your head. Other times, the game will put you up against something you literally cannot beat because it refuses to give you the cards/relics/items you need to win. I hate saying it's \"unfair\" because life isn't fair, but this is a video game. Video games should be for fun, not for testing people's patience. If I wanted my patience tested, I'd go play Overwatch. And I hate that the RNG is what this entire game boils down to. It's 100% luck of the draw (no pun intended). If you don't get good cards, good luck with winning. If you don't get good relics, just throw your next fight to get the XP and restart your run. This isn't one of those games where you can just magically win through trying harder. If the game doesn't give you what you need, you will fail. If you think otherwise, you're just delusional. \n\nAnd don't get me wrong, almost 150k positive reviews shows that many people love this game. This isn't me telling you to NOT buy it. This is simply what I experienced in my very limited playtime with the game. Your mileage, views, thoughts, and feelings may vary.\n\nEdit: \n\nSo, I've continued playing a bit, and I wanted to add something:\n\nI figured out why I dislike this game so much. Making me get rid of my cards when I have 3 expendable energy per round (unless you use potions or cards that give you energy, which are few and far between) is why I absolutely hate this game. It completely removes any element of strategy that this game could possibly claim to have, because there is no strategy to be had when you wipe the slate clean every 10 seconds.\n\nYou can rarely use all of the cards in your hand, and you may want to save something for the next round, but because the game forces you to give up your cards each and every round (unless you're using the final unlockable character and then expending energy to retain cards for your next round or you get the relic that lets you keep your hand), it's completely and utterly pointless. There's times where you're forced to take damage because you literally won't be given shields to mitigate any damage. There's times where you'll get only shields when the enemy WON'T attack on that round. Just let me keep my cards. Every other card battler does. \n\nThen there's the caveat of keeping your cards with the relic...You also keep all of the cursed cards/unplayable cards as well, which, unless you use a card that lets you exhaust them or you use the potion that lets you get rid of cards in your hand, you can get completely stuck with a bunch of nonsense in your hand. \n\nThe more I play this, the more I realize the devs never really had a thought in their head and just continually threw things into the mix that made the experience worse for players who are just trying to have fun with the game. There are so many QoL things that should be in the game, but just aren't. It's really quite sad. \n\nMaybe my RNG is especially bad, but I'm erring more on the side that the game just wants me to fail without giving me any rewards to force me to play and fail even more to give me mediocre rewards after banging my head against a wall for hours, without giving me any sense of accomplishment. \n\nAt least in other card battlers with a roguelike element (Inscryption, for instance) you get at least some sense that you've done something, even if you fail. That's the reason why even when I failed at Inscryption 20 times before I finally beat it, I felt okay. Because after each run, you get the opportunity to craft a card that will help you in the next run. With Slay the Spire, I get nothing but a headache because it takes 10 runs to \"level up\" and get access to a whopping 3 new cards that may not ever show up because each person has 95 cards that are special to them ontop of whatever other random nonsense that the game decides to put in your deck. The average run is anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes for me so far. So it's taking 2+ hours for me to even see any kind of progress, which is just abysmal for any kind of roguelike game. \n\nAnd those 2+ hours of progress are generally within the first two Acts. I spend so much time thinking and planning, and the more I do it, the more annoyed I get, because you can plan for everything and the RNG will still screw you over.\n\n As of writing this review, I spent 2 hours getting to the second boss trying to get as much health and taking as little damage as possible, and the RNG still screwed me over because he decided to pop his insta-kill move and the game didn't give me a shield or any cards that allow me to draw extra cards. But the hand before that, I had 3 shields, why could I get one shield to mitigate even a little bit of that 52 damage that comes off of that BS move? \n\nThe crazy part? The first run that I ever completed took 55 minutes. Didn't plan for anything, just kept throwing my deck at the wall until I made it through. Now, no matter what I do, I can't get past the second boss, and that's after an additional 3-4 hours of playing. The only difference? I changed the character I was playing, but there's NO way in hell that has made that much of a difference given it's one of the first characters the game expects you to play with. \n\nHow can you make the RNG in your game THIS bad?

In the end, I decided to go for the game\r\ngiven it\u2019s priced the lowest it\u2019s ever been at 50% off (Microsoft should really\r\nimprove their discounts) but either way, I played it and\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019m quite glad that I did because Obsidian has done something remarkable with this\r\nidea of being in a small world; the universe they created is packed with details and\r\nsurprises to uncover. There are areas of the map where you\u2019ll find spiders sleeping\r\nor guarding their layers, in other cases you\u2019ll find boxes of mints lying around in\r\nplace for you to go in and crack each candy with a mallet so you can use it as food,\r\nthen there\u2019s even more crazy areas that turn something as mundane as climbing a\r\nsmall plant into an actual set piece; the game is filled with moments that highlight\r\nthe uniqueness of its concept, it\u2019s very effective, because not only is it a good idea\r\nfor a game, but thanks to Obsidian imagination and work ethic, it is a game that\u2019s\r\ndone with care and love. Grounded is remarkably well done.\r\n\r\nThere are also numerous options to customize your experience, with modular\r\ndifficulty settings as well as different presets to use if you don\u2019t want to fiddle with\r\neach option; on top of that you have different modes, like sandbox mode that lets\r\nyou play without following any type of story, or a creative mode that can be played\r\nwithout, or with bugs who aren\u2019t aggressive to the player. I also really enjoy they\r\nadded unlimited New Game Plus options with unlockables up to your 10th run,\r\nalthough you can keep going even further than that if you\u2019d like; I love when games\r\nprovide you with controls over their game, it\u2019s as if the developers understand it is\r\ntheir creation, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s also your game.\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s visuals also hold up really well, the game has a very particular\r\naesthetic that is cartoony but without loosing detail, so all the bugs have an added\r\ncharm to them, as well as details; there\u2019s even a compendium that you can feel by\r\nidentifying them with binoculars, or with your hands placed over your eyes as\r\nbinoculars -it\u2019s the game\u2019s version of binos-.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a remarkable game done with a lot of passion and care, it is a\r\ngame that has options for everyone to play, with a beautifully crafted concept\r\nbehind it and a focused gameplay-narrative experience. It is a pricy game, even on\r\nsale, but that\u2019s Microsoft to blame; either way, in my earnest opinion, I do believe\r\nit\u2019s worth your time and, by extension, your money.", "hours": 60, "hoursAtReview": 60, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734191313}, {"text": "Top 5 games I've ever played.

The world in this game is amazing and impressive and only gets more interesting as you explore into new and more challenging biomes. If you've ever wondered what it would be like if you got \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\"-ed, this game will deliver amazing results. Combine that with some retro-futuristic 80s sci-fi to enable the shrinking, and you've got Grounded. The world feels vivid and exciting to explore and conquer.\r\n\r\nThe base-building mechanics are tried-and-true building akin to most any non-block-based open world survival crafting game (think Ark/Conan Exiles/FO 4). It is relatively seamless and extremely forgiving, with the ability to turn on fully refunded crafting supplies, or simply move segments of your structures one tile at a time with absolutely no downsides. There is a stability mechanic to building that will prohibit you from building massive walkways in the sky a'la Satisfactory, but that can also be toggled. \r\n\r\nThe combat is relatively simple, with melee weapons being regular 3-hit combos with only left clicking and blocking incoming attacks, which heavily rewards perfectly parrying enemies. The weapons have a surprising amount of variety as far as effects on you and your enemies, and enemy weaknesses and resistances (as well as your own depending on your weapons/equipment/perks) play a significant role in the ease or difficulty of any encounter. If fighting \"giant\" bugs in the back yard isn't your style, or you want to engage enemies only when you want to, they can be toggled as passive enabling you to explore relatively risk-free, however in my biased opinion this detracts from the experience significantly. It is a survival game, after all.\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty strong as well, and I'm about to finish my first playthrough after having played off-and-on since early access began. The game has grown into a full and well-rounded experience and the story is fun. Once completed, New Game+ allows you to continue in the yard, resetting the story quests and upping the variety and challenges posed by your enemies as well as altering the world in other interesting ways, but allows you to retain all of your structures and progress. NG+ can be repeated multiple times with the challenges increasing multiple times. \r\n\r\nTop notch world, satisfying exploration, solid construction mechanics, and with relative depth in the crafting system towards late-mid game that can satisfy both those who want to delve into the crafting system trying new weapons with different effects while not holding back (too much) those who want to ignore them. The combat is relatively simple but still satisfying when you go up against one of the most frightening early-game enemies that you could only hope to run from, except a few hours later you're actively hunting them instead, having learned all their telegraphed moves and their weaknesses. \r\n\r\nThis is a fantastic open-world survival crafting game that can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike. With up to 4 player multiplayer it is truly best experienced with friends, but is fun solo as well.  \r\n\r\nBe warned that arachnophobia may be a good reason for you to steer clear of this title, though. Personally, the floating blobs that \"arachophobia mode\" turn the spiders into are just as frightening to me, and besides that the mosquitoes and wasps give me the heebie-jeebies more than the spiders.\r\n\r\n", "hours": 10884, "hoursAtReview": 7170, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1732681374}, {"text": "This is a really solid survival-crafting game that offers a pretty polished, guided experience.

A lot has changed in -STRIVE- (there are no more super moves that are instant kills, many combos had been changed, we've got new characters, new stories, new hopes and fears), but the spirit of the series is still the same. Mankind knew that they cannot change society. So, instead of reflecting on themselves, they blamed the beasts. The game is still being developed (new characters, new arenas, etc.), the player base is satisfactory and netcode is pretty good. Its story mode is a \"visual novel\" and it has been prepared with due care, I'm into, I've got some multiple-wows and me likey.

I'll preface this by saying I'm not some amazing player but I did make it into celestial in older versions of the game. \nBalance wise: They made some system changes that disproportionately benefited most the top tiers, basically just buffing them compared to the rest of the cast. These top tiers either got slap on the wrist nerfs or no nerfs at all. Meanwhile a lot of other cast members were nerfed, with some of the low/bottom tiers being nerfed the hardest. \nThe balance patch also outright removed technical stuff from a few a members as well. No one thought they were too strong. They removed them to lower the barrier to entry, but in the process, screwed over the people who have been playing for years. The removals weren't just things that were added a patch ago, they've been in the game for years, some even existed in the previous titles for over a decade. It basically deleted a few cast members and replaced them with lookalikes. These changes weren't even addressing some sort of problem the community had with these characters. It was just sorta random MASSIVE balance changes that no one was asking for.\nStrive is still a good game but I don't know if I could actually recommenced someone to buy it now. The game isn't for the more competitive side, given that they remove skill expressive gameplay and basically reworked a few characters YEARS into the games lifespan. But it has problems for casual fans as well. A lot of the annoying \"skip neutral buttons\" that can noob stomp are still in the game as well as other mechanics that new players are gonna be annoyed and struggle with.\n\nThe games DLC policy is also becoming more and more of a problem. It's a 40$ game with 15 characters. Currently there are 14 DLC characters with another 3 coming out over the course of the next year. There will be MORE DLC than base game conent. In addition the DLC more than doubles the price of the game (50$ more for all DLC  characters as of November 2024). DLC passes have become more common than having you buy new editions of the game but I think strive is the only major fighting game out there asking you to pay more than double the base games price for all its cast.\n\nSeason 4 has also been buggy. Just plain buggy. Some gamebreaking, like a character having an infinite, or another one having an infinite blockstring from roundstart. The game just feels bad. \nThe game is testing out a more chaotic, more fun than competitive 3v3 mode and that's been good, but this seems like a general part of the game being pivoted to an even more casual experience years in. Strive feels sorta empty, its not appealing to a competitive playerbase... but the more casual playerbase is discouraged since the game isn't FULLY committing that way with questionable balance decisions and a ridiculous DLC policy.\nI can't really recommend you buy this game, espeically at close to full price in its current state. It's still a good game, a great game even, but I believe its in a rough spot. I'd keep your eye on it for the time being, its not gonna die like DNF Duel and it will still get updates. I hope that throughout season 4 I can change my opinion on this.\n\nTL;DR Game feels like directionless after recent updates, DLC policy is too aggressive, and a few too many bugs are holding down a genuinely amazing game. Just buy it on at least a half off sale if you really want it.  You'll probably still have fun just not worth the full price.", "hours": 18307, "hoursAtReview": 18307, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732488314}, {"text": "Piece of crap S4 balance patch: dumbed down half of the characters or got rid of their possible interesting combo routes and player expression, fricking killed Potemkin, and made damage numbers pretty absurd.\n\nJust revert it.", "hours": 20549, "hoursAtReview": 20549, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732625850}, {"text": "It just feels less and less like Guilty Gear with each update.", "hours": 2021, "hoursAtReview": 2021, "recommended": false, "timestamp": 1732252365}, {"text": "i love the lore, characters and gameplay\r\nthis is my first time learning a fighting game and it's so fun\r\n\r\ni also love testament", "hours": 8454, "hoursAtReview": 8205, "recommended": true, "timestamp": 1734025509}, {"text": "+++++ Fitting conclusion and swan song to Daisuke Ishiwatari's Guilty Gear world and story.\r\n+++++ Long term dev support, we're on the 4th season with no -sign- of them stopping.\r\n+++++ Stellar arcsys fighter graphics\r\n+++++ Amazing OST including ALL the soundtracks from prior guilty gear entries.\r\n++++ Character designs evolving with their story\r\n++++ Downloadable combos from the community help a lot with learning a character.\r\n++++ Large Varied Roster that keeps growing.\r\n+++ Game is made by artists and metal heads.\r\n+++ Despite it's flaws it's a blast to play\r\n+++ Most successful guilty gear by far.\r\n\r\nNeutral: Supposedly more accessible than Xrd but it's still pretty complex for newcomers.\r\n\r\n----- The tower is probably the worst example of a ranked system.

TLDR; village builder and medieval life sim that you must try.\r\n\r\nThis game is an absolute jewel and has so much potential for development, for additional features, for additional interactions, but the base that it has is absolutely incredible and immersive. The way you gradually settle your village in an open world and begin developing your villagers and your town is endearing.\r\n\r\nThe only downside of the game is how often your character will voice complains about heat, cold, thirst, and hunger (multiple times per minute), but I'm sure this will eventually be adjusted as game continues growing. I just turned off voice volume, which unfortunately turns off everybody's voices. On the topic of voices, hopefully you don't mind the memes, because they are bountiful and plenty among the lines of the NPCs. Some can be immersion-breaking, such as a kid chanting out 'Ka-me-ha-me-haa' while they play, or male NPCs constantly greeting their spouses with the Star Wars reference 'Hello there, general wife!'. A reduction of frequency, or an augment on voice line variety would greatly assist on finding a happy medium among memes and maintaining a happy immersion.\r\n\r\nThe game has some really detailed mechanics, such as remains of crops staying behind after you pick them up (leaves, straws, stems), trees gradually growing through the years from small saplings, weather changes and NPCs commenting on them, wildlife hunting each other down (prey v. predators), apparently decorative items which NPCs interact with... in short, the game shows that it has love put into it, tons of it, and I sincerely hope it keeps on growing. It is a beautiful world with many possibilities, and it makes me very happy that there's a multiplayer to it, because the potential for home-making with friends is delightful. It would be neat to introduce concepts such as war, pest (on soil and folk), famine, drought...\r\n\r\nLike I mentioned, tons of potential. I am very, very excited to see this game grow, and sincerely thank developers for their continued work on this gem.
